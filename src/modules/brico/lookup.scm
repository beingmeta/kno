;;; Looking up words

;;; This code looks up words in BRICO, potentially applying
;;;  some entirely textual cleverness.

;;; The TRYHARD argument indicates how hard to try when doing a lookup.
;;; The values are roughly interpreted as follows:
;;;  #f don't try anything but basestring normalization (MalmÃ¶ ==> Malmo)
;;;      and capitalization normalization
;;;  #t or 1 strips out internal punctuation (e.g. set-up ==> setup)
;;;  >1 looks for misspellings (using metaphone) and also combines
;;;     porter-stemming with metaphone.  Note that these are probably
;;;     not really portable between languages, but that's a TODO.
;;;  >2 look for compounds with overlapping words and picks the
;;;      highest ranking concepts that have an overlap greater 3,
;;;      where a correctly spelled word gets 2 points and a possible
;;;      variant gets 1.
;;;  >4 just like above but accepts any overlap greater than 2
;;;  Warning: this compound finding algorithm has a potential issue
;;;   in that BRICO's fragment indexing doesn't distinguish fragments
;;;   from the same compound, so a concept with terms "George Bush" and
;;;   "Scourge of Washington" would match a fragment-based search for
;;;   "George Washington".
