;;; This is a task loop engine where a task applies a function to a
;;;  bunch of data items organized into batches.

;;; Currently, this engine supports thread parallelism but not job
;;; (process) parallelism. There are three levels:

;;; 1. Task (outermost, cross-process)
;;; 2. Loop (single process, single invocation of engine/run, often one invocation per process)
;;; 3. Batch (single thread, set of items)

;;; While running, a table (slotmap) is associated with each of the
;;; levels, called *state*, *loop-state*, and *batch_state*
;;; respectively.


;;; The engine uses a FIFO of batches and a pool of threads pulling
;;; batches from the FIFO and processing them. For a single batch,
;;; there can be serveral phases (this is implemented by ENGINE-THREADFN).

#|Markdown

1. BEFOREFN is called on the batch, the batch-state, the loop-state, and the
task state)

2. PROCESSFN is the item function itself. It is called on each element
of the batch. If it takes two arguments, it is called on the item and
the batch state. If it takes 4 arguments, it is called on the item,
batch state, loop state, and task state.

3. AFTERFN is called on the batch, the batch-state, the loop-state, and the
task state)

4. The 'loop state' is then 'bumped'. This updates the total
'items' (number of items processed), total 'batches' (number of
batches processed), and 'vtime' (how much realtime this thread spent
on the batch).

5. LOGFN is then called on:
* the items processed;
* the clock time spent on PROCESS
* the clock time spent on BEFORE+PROCESS+AFTER
* the batch state
* the loop state
* the task state

5. The STOPFNs are then called and if any return non-false, the loop
'stops'. This means that the current thread stops processing batches
and all of the other threads stop when they're done with their current
batch.

6. If the loop hasn't stopped, the loop's *monitors* are called. A
monitor is either a function or a pair of functions. In the first
case, the function is simply called on the loop-state; in the second,
the CAR is called on the loop-state and the CDR is called if the CAR
returns #t.

The monitors can stop the loop by storing a value in the 'stopped
slot of the loop state.
