(in-module 'brico/dtermcache)
;;; Background dterm computation (which can take a while)

;;; This provides a dterm cache which is automatically filled by
;;; background threads.  This keeps threads from blocking on dterm
;;; computation, which can take a while for some concepts.

;;; When a dterm is requested, the cache is checked; if there is a
;;; value there, it is returned (and a #f is converted to a {}).  If
;;; there isn't a value in the cache, #f is stored in the table and
;;; the request (a pair of a concept and a language) is pushed into a
;;; fifo.  Some number of background threads (configured by
;;; DTERMTHREADS) are reading from this FIFO, computing dterms
;;; and storing them back in the cache.
