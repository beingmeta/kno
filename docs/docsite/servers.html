    <p>If the <a href="concepts.html#dtypes">DType protocol</a> is the
      glue of complex FramerD applications, servers are their struts and
      skeleton. Both FramerD data (pools of OIDs), annotations (indices),
      general services (natural language parsing, associative searching),
      and application services (parsing of particular formats, management
      of shared state) can be and often are modularized into FramerD
      servers.</p>
    <p>In addition to encouraging modular design, the packaging of
      functions into servers allows computation and data to be
      distributed according to the diversity of resources and demand. The
      portability of FramerD's C kernel (from low end PCs and notebooks
      to multiple-processor production servers) permits processing to be
      arranged with respect to available processing, memory, and long
      term storage resources. The accessibility of servers from very
      lightweight DType clients permits point-of-interaction applications
      which can leverage very complex remote processing.</p>
    <p>For instance, a FramerD application can consist of a 30K java
      applet on a palmtop accessing a server on a nearby PC connecting to
      a distant high-throughput function server on the outside of a
      firewall which synthesizes results from knowledge bases provided by
      several high-performance database servers on the inside of the
      firewall. And this may be only one path of connectivity between
      these servers and services! Other applications or services may
      connect these components in different ways.</p>
    <p>A FramerD server is essentially a remote Scheme evaluator which
      processes expressions and returns values. This evaluator typically
      processes a variant of the Scheme language, reduced (in some ways)
      to enhance security and extended (in other ways) to provide
      particular functionality. For example, servers do not usually
      provide direct access to the local file system or to other servers.
      However, most servers do provide special functions, which can range
      from managing object persistence to processing natural language to
      serving as special gateways to other network services.</p>
    <p>In distributed FramerD applications, two special kinds of
      servers are OID servers and index servers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OID servers</strong> provide access to the persistent
	object database by offering retrieval and (possibly) modification
	for a range of OIDs (object identifiers)</li>
      <li><strong>Index servers</strong> provide associational indices
	from complex structured <em>keys</em> to sets of OIDs or other
	objects.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>FramerD servers are nearly always implemented by the executable
      <tt>fdserver</tt> and configured by use of a <em>server control
	file</em> described below.</p>
    <h2><a name="simple" id="simple">Simple Servers</a></h2>
    <p>The simplest way to start a new server is to use a <em>server
	control file</em> as the single argument to the program
      <tt>fdserver</tt>. A server control file typically has a name of
      the form <em>name<tt>.fdz</tt></em> and consists of FDScript code
      which is processed to initialize the server. Unless overriden, the
      server evaluates the forms in the control file and then starts
      listening for remote requests at a particular <em>port name</em>.
      This port name can either be set in the control file (by the
      function <tt>set-port-id!</tt>) or will be derived from the control
      file's <em>name</em>. The port name is converted into a port number
      (what the network really uses) using either a system-wide database
      of service names (often found in /etc/services under Unix) or by
      <em>touch-tone encoding</em> (so "brico" corresponds to the port
      27425).</p>
    <p>The server control file is simply an FDScript file which
      initializes the pools, indices, and procedures which the server
      will provide. Applications or components can be bundled with canned
      ".fdz" files for setting up a local version of the specified data
      or processing servers.</p>
    <p>For example, the Brico knowledge base comes bundled with the
      file <tt>brico.fdz</tt>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
	#!/usr/local/bin/fdserver
	;;; This is the file brico.fdz
	
	(set-port-id! "brico")
	
	;; Just run locally if the file use-localhost exists in
	;;  the same directory as this file
	(when (file-exists? (get-component "use-localhost"))
	(use-localhost!))
	
	(when (bound? ADMIN-SERVER)
	(use-pool ADMIN-SERVER)
	(use-index ADMIN-SERVER))
	
	;;; Intialize brico server
	(define brico-pool (use-pool (get-component "brico.pool")))
	(define brico-index (use-index (get-component "brico.index")))
	(define cyc-pool (use-pool (get-component "cyc/cyc.pool")))
	(define cyc-index (use-index (get-component "cyc/cyc.index")))
	
	(serve-pool brico-pool)
	(serve-index brico-index)
	
	(serve-pool cyc-pool)
	(serve-index cyc-index)
	
	(define (find-synsets word)
	(find-frames words-index 'words word))
	(define (get-synonyms x)
	(fget (find-synsets x) 'words))
	
	(define (help)
	"This server provide the BRICO database and special functions
	to access it.")
	
	(module-export! '{get-synonyms help})
    </pre></blockquote>
    <p>which sets up the server to provide access the OID pools
      <tt>brico.pool</tt> and <tt>cyc.pool</tt> and to their respective
      indices as well. Once the server is running, clients can access
      these pools and indices remotely with specifications such as
      <tt>(use-pool "brico@myhost")</tt>. It will provide remote servers
      with access to these pools but not (for instance, the pool and
      index derived from <tt>ADMIN-SERVER</tt> (which might be used by
      additional procedures to be defined later. This homegrown
      <tt>brico@myhost</tt> server can be accessed just like the
      <tt>brico@db.beingmeta.com</tt> server described in <a href=
							     "users-guide.html">the user's guide</a>.</p>
    <p>The particular call to <tt>set-port-id!</tt> in
      <tt>brico.fdz</tt> is redundant in this case, since
      <tt>fdserver</tt> would figure it out from the name of the
      configuration file. The server will then listen to this port on all
      of the addresses currently assigned to the machine. This can be
      modified by using a portid of the form
      <tt><em>portname</em>@<em>host</em></tt> where the server will only
      listen to the port <tt>portid</tt> on the addresses assigned to
      <em>hostname</em> (which can just be a numeric IP address in dotted
      decimal format, e.g. <tt>18.85.2.138</tt>). For example,</p>
    <pre>
      (SET-PORT-ID! "brico@127.0.0.1")
    </pre>
    would set the server up to listen only on the default localhost
    address.
    <p>The example configuration file <tt>brico.fdz</tt> also defines
      the procedures <tt>find-synsets</tt>, <tt>get-synonyms</tt> and
      <tt>help</tt>. The server control file implicitly creates an
      environment (the "server environment") where these procedures are
      defined. At the end of the configuration file, the call to
      <tt>module-export!</tt> determines which of the definitions will
      actually be accessible by remote servers. In this case, the
      <tt>help</tt> function and the <tt>get-synonyms</tt> function are
      available and can be called thus:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
	<font size="-1">
	  % dtcall brico@myhost get-synonyms "example"
	  "good_example"
	  "model"
	  "example"
	  "exemplar"
	  "exercise"
	  "instance"
	  "specimen"
	  "sample"
	  "quotation"
	  "representative"
	  "illustration"
	  "object_lesson"
	  "lesson"
	  "deterrent_example"
	  "protoplast"
	  "module"
	  "ensample"
	  "paradigm"
	</font>
    </pre></blockquote>
    <h2><a name="security" id="security">Security Concerns</a></h2>
    <p>Running a FramerD server allows clients on the Internet to run
      programs on the server's host machine, a potentially risky
      proposition. This risk is reduced in fdserver by taking advantage
      of FDScript's native security model. The design of FDScript
      separates out "risky" functions --- including access to the local
      filesystem, external program execution, establishment of network
      connections, etc --- into a separate module. The evaluator used by
      fdserver does not have access to this module but can only access
      "safe" functions and whatever functions are defined in the server
      configuration file(s).</p>
    <p>The initialization files read by <tt>fdserver</tt> are processed
      in the full FDScript environment, so the definitions they provide
      can access restricted functions. This allows an implementor to
      write "safe" wrappers around system functions that remote users can
      access. For instance, even though proscription of <tt>fopen</tt>
      keeps anonymous clients from opening arbitrary files, a user
      procedure defined in the initialization files can still open a
      particular file and provide access to it.</p>
    <p>The "sandbox" provided by the limited server environment
      provides substantial protection, but additional levels of
      protection can be provided by having the server run as a limited
      user. The "identity" of a server can be set by the
      <tt>SET-UID!</tt> procedure in the server control file. This only
      works when the system is originally running as a privleged user
      (root under unix). In order to avoid inadvertently running a server
      as root, servers started as root will always change their uid to
      the string specified by the configuration variable
      <tt>FDSERVER_USER</tt> (or <tt>"nobody"</tt> it is not defined) and
      will change their group id to the group specified by the string
      <tt>FDSERVER_GROUP</tt> (or <tt>"nogroup"</tt> if it is not
      defined).</p>
    <h2><a name="control" id="control">Controlling Client
	Access</a></h2>
    <p>If the initialization files for a server defines a
      <tt>CLIENT-OK?</tt> procedure in the server environment, this is
      called on all client addresses before a connection is established.
      The client address will typically be in standard `.edu' or `.com'
      form or as dotted decimal addresses if the symbolic hostname cannot
      be determined. For example, the following <tt>CLIENT-OK?</tt>
      definition permits access only from within the MIT Media Lab
      domain:</p>
    <pre>
      (define (client-ok? client-addr)
      (has-suffix "media.mit.edu" client-addr))
    </pre>
    <p>In addition, the procedure <tt>(CLIENT-ID)</tt> returns the
      address of the client being served. This allows servers to
      customize their processing based on client identity. For instance,
      the following definition uses two different parser servers
      depending on the domain of the client being served:</p>
    <pre>
      (define (parse string)
      (if (has-suffix ".media.mit.edu" (client-id))
      (dtcall "parse@inside-parse" parse string)
      (dtcall "parse@outside-parse" parse string)))
    </pre>
    <h2><a href="maintainer">Maintainer Access</a></h2>
    <p>FramerD servers can provide access to an unrestricted
      environment with the <tt>maintainer</tt> procedure. This procedure
      takes an expression and evaluates it in an unrestricted
      environment; however, it can only be called by clients on
      particular remote hosts. The procedure <tt>MAINTAINER-OK?</tt>,
      which must be defined to use the <tt>maintainer</tt> procedure,
      validates a maintenance connection, as in:</p>
    <pre>
      (define (maintainer-ok? client-addr)
      (equal? "admin.framerd.org" client-addr))
    </pre>
    <p>This definition only lets connections from the host
      <tt>admin.framerd.org</tt> use <tt>maintainer</tt>. Note that this
      particular method is subject to IP spoofing attacks. A better
      approach would be to require that forms to be evaluated in an
      unrestricted environment be cryptographically signed
      (volunteers?).</p>
    <h2><a name="complicated" id="complicated">A more complicated
	<tt>fdserver</tt></a></h2>
    <p>A more complicated server control file can combines pool/index
      access together with special functions related to the data it is
      providing. For example, the following file provides read-only
      access to a pool and index recording user comments but also
      provides an external function for creating a new comment:</p>
    <pre>
      (define comments-pool (use-pool (get-component "comments.pool")))
      (define comments-index (use-index (get-component "comments.index")))
      
      (serve-pool comments-pool)
      (serve-pool comments-index)
      
      ;; External clients can't write the pool or index
      (set-read-only!)
      
      (define (record-comment user text (time #f))
      (let* ((tstamp (or time (timestamp)))
      (frame (frame-create comments-pool
      'user user 'comment text 'time tstamp)))
      (index-frame comments-index frame 'user)
      ;; This will allow free text search on the comment
      (index-frame comments-index frame
      'comment (stem-english-word (elts (segment text))))
      ;; This will allow more clever searching on the user name too
      (index-frame comments-index frame 'user (elts (segment user)))
      ;; And the same for the timestamp; e.g. get-timekeys might
      ;;  return something like: {JAN 2001 D5 WINTER 3AM MORNING}
      (index-frame comments-index frame 'time
      (get-timekeys (get frame 'time)))
      frame))
      
      (module-export! 'record-comment)
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, external clients cannot write directly to the
      database, but they can search and examine it. They can also add to
      it in a particular, rigorous way defined by the procedure
      <tt>record-comment</tt>. This method ensures that the frame created
      is timestamped and indexed in a useful and consistent way.</p>
    <h2><a href="admin">Administering Servers</a></h2>
    <p>The FramerD executable <tt>fdmanager</tt> provides a way of
      easily managing multiple servers. Based on a <em>master control
	file</em>, <tt>fdmanager</tt> starts a set of FramerD servers,
      arranges for their standard and error output to go to specific log
      files, and will restart them if they terminate. The master control
      file has multiple lines of the form:</p>
    <pre>
      [wait=<em>secs</em>] [dependent]
      &lt;<em>server control file</em>&gt; <em>fdserver args</em>...  
    </pre>
    The parameter <tt>wait</tt> specifies how long <tt>fdmanager</tt>
    should wait for the server to start before moving onto the next
    server in the file. The flag <tt>dependent</tt> indicates that this
    server is dependent on the preceding server and should be restarted
    if the preceding server is restarted. The <em>server control
      file</em> is an <tt>.fdz</tt> file passed to <tt>fdserver</tt> and
    the <em>fdserver args</em> are passed along with it. Additional
    information about <tt>fdmanager</tt> can be found on its man page.
    <p>FramerD comes with an <tt>fdservers</tt> init file designed to
      work with the SYSV init scheme common on many Unix systems. This
      file is a shell script which tags the commands <tt>start</tt>,
      <tt>stop</tt>, <tt>restart</tt>, and <tt>status</tt>. It works by
      starting an <tt>fdmanager</tt> process using the file
      <tt><em>framerd dir</em>/servers</tt> as the control file (e.g.
      <tt>/usr/local/share/framerd/servers</tt>).</p>
    <p>When started from the <tt>fdservers</tt> init script or some
      other system-wide startup mechanism (for instance,
      <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>), servers begin by running as root. However,
      as mentioned above, they almost immediately change their user and
      group ids to either <tt>nobody</tt> or <tt>nogroup</tt> or the
      values of the environment variables <tt>FDSERVER_USER</tt> and
      <tt>FDSERVER_GROUP</tt> if they are valid user and group names.
      Since the server running under these names will need to access the
      directory of the <tt>.fdz</tt> file (to write status files such as
      <tt>.pid</tt> and <tt>.nid</tt> as well as reading the data files
      there), it is usually best to have the groups on the files in this
      directory set to the FDSERVER_GROUP and to have appropriate group
      access permissions set.</p>
    <p>The <tt>fdservers</tt> init script sets above the environment
      variables to the user and group name <tt>fdaemon</tt>. Creating
      this user and group (or changing the init script) is probably a
      good idea for non-experimental installations.</p>
    <h2><a name="hairy" id="hairy">Invoking <tt>fdserver</tt></a></h2>
    <p>Like most of the FramerD shell commands, fdserver can be paased
      configuration variables of the form <tt>VAR=VAL</tt> or
      <tt>VAR=+VAL</tt> on the command line. Additional options for
      invoking fdserver are listed when fdserver is passed the
      <tt>--help</tt> option:</p>
    <pre>
      Usage: fdserver [options*] (&lt;service_name&gt; | %lt;port_id&gt; | &lt;server_init_file&gt;) 
      
      where options may define configuration variables, e.g.
      FRAMERD_USER=hal9k
      or may be direct options for fdserver:
      --local                Run the server locally (e.g. as localhost)
      --log <var>filename</var>       Log connections and statistics to <var>filename</var>
      (use '-' for stdout, '--' for stderr)
      --trace <var>filename</var>     Log transaction details to <var>filename</var>
      (use '-' for stdout, '--' for stderr)
      --access (read-only | locking | run-with-scissors)
      Limit OID and association access according
      to ruleset specified
      -c | --config <var>filename</var>    Load symbol definitions from <var>filename</var>
      -m | --module <var>moduleid</var>    has the server use the module <var>moduleid</var>
      -f | --file <var>fdscript_file</var>
      Load <var>fdscript_file</var> before starting
      -e | --eval '<var>fdscript_code</var>'
      Evaluate <var>fdscript_code</var> before starting
    </pre>
    <p>The arguments to the <tt>--access</tt> option have the following
      meaning:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>read-only</dt>
      <dd>the served pools or indices cannot be remotely modified at
	all</dd>
      <dt>locking</dt>
      <dd>oid-level locking is provided for served pools</dd>
      <dt>sloppy</dt>
      <dd>OIDs can be written but no locking is provided</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The value of this option will have no effect if the server
      itself cannot modify one of its pools or indices; in such a case,
      the pool or index is read-only no matter what access is
      specified.</p>
    <p>For debugging purposes, two useful arguments to fdserver are
      <tt>--log</tt> and <tt>--trace</tt>. These activiate logging and
      tracing (respectively) and send the results to a specified file. If
      a dash (-) is specified as the file, results go to the standard
      output; if two dashes (--) are specified, results go to the
      standard error. <strong>Logging</strong> reports each connections
      and disconnections of clients with the server.
      <strong>Tracing</strong> reports each request and the value
      returned.</p>
    <p>One can specify that a server only runs locally by passing the
      command line arguments <tt>--local yes</tt> to <tt>fdserver</tt>.
      You can then access this server through server ids of the form
      "port@localhost". This is useful if you are using FramerD on a
      machine which is only intermittenly connected to the network.</p>
    <p>Each of these options can also be specified in the server
      control file, by the following functions:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>set-read-only!</dt>
      <dd>sets the server to be externally read-only</dd>
      <dt>set-sloppy!</dt>
      <dd>sets the server to be externally writable, without locking</dd>
      <dt>set-log!</dt>
      <dd>takes two stream arguments: one for connection logging, one for
	comprehensive transaction logging</dd>
    </dl>
