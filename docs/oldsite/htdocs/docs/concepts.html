<TR><TH class="title">OIDs and the object database</TH>
    <TD class="gloss">FramerD provides a simple object database which
associates numeric <B>object identifers</B> (OIDs) with DType
structures. DType structures can contain these object identifiers so
that one DType structure can point to the location in the object
database where another DType structure is stored.  </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</a>

<P>One of the major components of FramerD is a distributed persistent
object database.  Objects in the database are designated by unique
object identifiers or OIDs. The allocation of OIDs is managed so that
different users, projects, or programs will not use the same OID for
different purposes.

<P>An OID is a 64-bit address pointing into a virtual memory space
whose locations are associated with complex structured objects.  These
objects can also contain pointers to other OIDs.  The idea is that one
program can associate an OID with a particular value (for instance,
the integer <tt>3</tt> or the list <tt>("Three" THREE 3)</tt>).  Other
programs can retrieve this value (or whatever value replaces it) by
just knowing the OID to which it was assigned.  OIDs can be included
in other structures, written to files, and accessed through indices,
so that application users need not typically worry about the exact
numerical value of an OID.

<P>OID's numeric IDs are further organized into continuous ranges
called <strong>pools</strong>.  Pools are used to organize the storage
and management of the values associated with OIDs.  There are
currently two kinds of pools: file pools are disk files containing
DTYPE representations for the values associated with a particular
range of OIDs; network pools are network servers using the DTYPE
protocol which likewise provide access to a particular range of OIDs.

<H2>OID values</H2>

<P>OIDs are associated with values which applications may access or
modify.  When an application makes changes to an OID's value, those
changes are local to the application until they are
<strong>committed</strong>, at which point they are saved to the
appropriate file or network pool.  When this occurs, the new value
will be visible to other applications which request it.

<P>Access and revision control is managed by locking particular OIDs.
When an application locks an OID, two things are guaranteed: that the
value which the application sees for the OID is the latest value; and
that the value will not be changed by any other application until
either the OID is committed or it is unlocked.  Locking of OIDs is
normally invisible to applications.  When an application sets an OID's
value locally, it locks it.  When the value is committed, it unlocks
it.

<P>For file pools, locking any OID in the pool locks the entire pool; for
network pools, OIDs are locked on an individual basis.

<P>Pools reflect both implementational and administrative properties:
the values associated with the OIDs in a particular pool are generally
provided by a particular file or server; the allocation of new OIDs
and the modification of the value for existing OIDs is generally the
responsibility of one administrative entity.

<H2>External Representations</H2>

<P>OIDs have two different external representations. A <dfn><B>literal
OID reference</dfn></B> has the form @hi/lo where hi is the high 32
bits of the address and lo is the low 32 bits, both in hex. For
example, an OID that looks like this <TT>@1/1b54e</TT> refers to the
address <TT>0x000000010001b54e</TT>.  A <dfn><B>logical OID
reference</dfn></B> has the form
<TT>@/<I>pool-id</I>/<I>offset</I></TT> and indicates an OID in a
particular pool. Thus, the reference <TT>@/brico/1b54e</TT> refers to
the same object shown above if the pool <TT>brico</TT> starts at
<TT>@1/0</TT>. In addition, when the system can figure out a name for
an OID, it appears after the @-expression identifying its address,
e.g.:
<PRE class=typescript>
@/brico/1b54e"NOUN.COGNITION synset for example, illustration, instance, and representative"
</PRE>
<P>to make it less cryptic to the user.

<P>The high 32 bits of an object identifer indicate the <dfn><B>super
pool</DFN></B> of the OID. The OID above, for instance, is in the super
pool <TT>0x1</TT>. The allocation of new object identifiers is based on
the division of the 64 bit address space into smaller <B>pools</B>. The
first such division is into super pools and subsequent divisions divide
super pools into smaller chunks. Each chunk consists of 2<super>i</super>
object identifiers.

<H2>Getting Pools, OIDs, and their values</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DIV ALIGN=right><I>The Lisp programmer knows the value of everything but
the cost of nothing.</I><BR>
Alan Perlis</DIV>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The FDScript procedure <TT>use-pool</TT> arranges for the current
session to access a particular pool of OIDs. It's single argument is
either a filename or a network specification of the sort used for
remote evaluation (e.g.  `brico@framerd.org'). Once <TT>use-pool</TT>
has been called, the value of an OID in the pool can be extracted by
the procedure <TT>OID-VALUE</TT> e.g.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(USE-POOL "brico@framerd.org")</strong>
[11:57:27 Session id=fdscript haase@eliza.media.mit.edu /OS:DIGITAL UNIX /Compiled:Feb 10 1997 /Started:Tue Feb 11 11:57:27 1997]
[11:57:27 Added pool brico@framerd.org]
[#POOL brico@framerd.org @1/0+1048576 {}]
[fdscript] <strong>(OID-VALUE @1/33334)</strong>
[SPELLING: "cause_to_tip" OBJ-NAME: "cause_to_tip" 
 SENSES: @/brico/32f96"VERB.MOTION synset for tip, cause_to_tip, and cause_to_tilt"
 RANKED-SENSES:
  (V 1 @/brico/32f96"VERB.MOTION synset for tip, cause_to_tip, and cause_to_tilt")]
</PRE>
<P>One can use the procedure <TT>random-oid</TT> to pick a random OID from
a pool, e.g.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(RANDOM-OID (USE-POOL "brico@framerd.org"))</strong>
@/brico/58e1"ADJ.ALL synset for functional"
[fdscript] <strong>(RANDOM-OID (USE-POOL "brico@framerd.org"))</strong>
@/brico/21a5e"alpha_particle"
</PRE>
<P>Pools can be stored in variables and used as arguments, e.g.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(define WORDNET (USE-POOL "brico@framerd.org"))</strong>
[fdscript] <strong>(RANDOM-OID wordnet)</strong>
@/brico/148d3"NOUN.ARTIFACT synset for stoup and stoop"
</PRE>
<P>Also, procedures which expect pools as arguments (like
<TT>ALLOCATE-OID</TT>) will also take strings and automatically
interpret them as pool specifications), for example:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(RANDOM-OID "brico@framerd.org")</strong>
@/brico/1d9a7"NOUN.COMMUNICATION synset for hillbilly_music"
</PRE>

<H2>Allocating and changing OIDs</H2>

<P>The procedure <TT>ALLOCATE-OID</TT> returns an OID from a pool; pools
can be either stored in files on disk or servers on a network. So we can
say:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(ALLOCATE-OID (USE-POOL "temp@framerd.org"))</strong>
[11:59:57 Added pool temp@framerd.org]
@/temp/40001
</PRE>
<P>to allocate an OID in the network pool <TT>"temp@framerd.org"</TT>.
(This pool is maintained for demo purposes at the Media Laboratory. Values
stored in this pool are subject to erasure whenever our disk space gets
tight). If we call ALLOCATE-OID again, we get a different oid:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(ALLOCATE-OID (USE-POOL "temp@framerd.org"))</strong>
@/temp/40002
</PRE>
<P>When an OID is newly allocated it has no values assigned to it, E.G. a
call to <TT>OID-VALUE</TT>
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(OID-VALUE @/temp/40001)</strong>
{}
</PRE>
<P>fails by returning no results. One can set the value of an OID with the
<TT>SET-OID-VALUE!</TT> procedure:
<PRE class=typescript>
(SET-OID-VALUE! @/temp/40001 "My first OID")
</PRE>
<P>allowing us to get the value we put there:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(OID-VALUE @a/40001)</strong>
"My first OID"
</PRE>

<H2>Saving and Reverting OID values</H2>

<P>When you modify the value associated with an OID, the value is only
changed locally until the changes are <I>committed</I> to the pool
containing the object. There are three basic `commitment' procedures
for OIDs and pools:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="COMMIT-OID">
    (COMMIT-OID <I>oid</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>saves the changes associated with a particular OID.
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="COMMIT-POOL">
    (COMMIT-POOL <I>pool</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>saves all the changes to a particular pool;
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="COMMIT-POOLS">(COMMIT-POOLS)</A></TT></B>
<DD>saves all the changes to OIDs in the current session, and
</DL>
<P><font color=red><strong>All changes are automatically committed if
your FDScript session exits normally (and lost if it exits
abnormally).</strong></font>

<P>Not all OIDs can be changed or modified. If you change an OID in a file
pool, the system attempts to lock the corresponding file before making
the change. The file stays locked until your process exits or the file
is explicitly unlocked. If you cannot lock the file --- because someone
else has locked it or the file is read-only --- you cannot change the value
associated with the OID stored in the file.

<P>If you change an OID in a network pool, the system attempts to lock
the individual OID before making the change. If this succeeds, the
local value for the OID is changed and the remote OID will be unlocked
when your changes are committed. If this fails, (for instance, the
network server will not permit you to lock the OID), the OID cannot be
modified. A server might refuse to lock an OID because another user
has locked the OID or because the OID is declared read-only.

<P>Before you've committed your changes, it is possible to back out of
the changes by <I>reverting</I> the modifications:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="REVERT-OID">(REVERT-OID <I>oid</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>undoes your changes to the individual OID <I>oid</I>.
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="REVERT-POOL">(REVERT-POOL <I>pool</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>undoes all the changes to OIDs in a particular pool</DD>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="REVERT-POOLS">(REVERT-POOLS)</A></TT></B>
<DD>undoes all the changes to OIDs in the current session that have not
yet been committed.
</DL>
<P>Two caveats: remember that committed changes cannot be reverted in
this way; also, only changes that directly affect the OID or its value
can be reverted. If you store a pointer to an OID in a hashtable, for
instance, reverting the OID will not remove the hash table entry.

<H2>Making file pools</H2>

<P>The frames created above were allocated and stored on a
demonstration server at MIT. Though the values might stay around for a
few days, they are unlikely to last longer for administrative
reasons. To create objects with more presistence, one has to either
use <B>file pools</B> maintained in files on the local file system or
use <B>network pools</B> maintained by oneself or others with more
persistence. Actually, the network servers you would use will rely on
pools maintained in files on their local file system, so eventually
someone has to worry about how OIDs live on disk in file
pools. Fortunately, dealing with file pools is straightforward.

<P>The procedure <TT>MAKE-FILE-POOL</TT> creates a file pool in the local
file system, E.G.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(MAKE-FILE-POOL "test.pool" 32)</strong>
[#POOL test.pool @a/140000+0/32 {}]
</PRE>
<P>creates a file pool containing 32 possible and no actual objects and and
whose first object will be @a/140000. We can allocate that first object
with <TT>allocate-oid</TT>:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(allocate-oid "test.pool")</strong>
@/test/0 ; <em>or @a/140000 if printed "literally"</em>
</PRE>
<P>Creating a pool automatically causes the pool to be <I>used</I>,
just as if you had called <TT>use-pool</TT> on the argument.

<P>The command-line program <TT>make-file-pool</TT> also creates file pools;
it looks just like the FDScript call, but without the parentheses, e.g.
<PRE class=typescript>
sh% make-file-pool test.pool 32
Created test.pool with space for 32 OIDs starting at @a/100
</PRE>
<P>This command line program is written in and invokes FDScript, but
it doesn't require that the user deal with the listener and associated
parentheses.  It also generates a message describing what it has done.

    <TD class="gloss">Frames are at the heart of FramerD, providing a way to

</TABLE>
</a>

<P>The word "frame" in FramerD comes from its support for frames, a
popular AI representation model. A <dfn>frame</DFN> in FramerD is an
OID whose value consists of a set of slots. Each slot consists of a
<defn>slotid</defn> --- either a symbol or an OID --- and a set of
values. Slots divide the description of objects into several labelled
parts. For instance, the following frame from the FramerD port of
WordNet represents the concept (synset) of an "example":
<PRE class=typescript>
SYNSET-ID:  3946824 <strong>[[[<em>Slot values may be numbers or strings.</em>]]]</strong>
SYNSET-TYPE:  "n"
WORDS: (4 values) <strong>[[[<em>A slot may have any number of values</em>]]]</strong>
   "representative"

    SENSE:  NOUN.COGNITION
    HYPERNYM:  @/brico/b709"NOUN.COGNITION synset for information"
    HYPONYM: (5 values) <strong>[[[<em>The values can also be pointers to other frames</em>]]]</strong>
       @/brico/1b56e"NOUN.COGNITION synset for exception"
       @/brico/1b56f"NOUN.COGNITION synset for precedent and case_in_point"
       @/brico/1b570"NOUN.COGNITION synset for quintessence"
       @/brico/1b571"NOUN.COGNITION synset for sample"
       @/brico/1b572"NOUN.COGNITION synset for specimen"
    A:  @/brico/b709"NOUN.COGNITION synset for information"
    SYNSET-DEPTH:  4
    SYNSET-HEIGHT:  3
    SYNSET-TOTAL-HYPONYMS:  8
    SYNSET-TOTAL-BRANCHING:  2
</PRE>

<P>The description above lists a number of <defn>slots</defn>, each of
which associates a particular <defn>slotid</defn>
(e.g. <tt>HYPERNYM</tt>) with a set of <defn>slot values</defn> (which
are abitrary objects).  This set of associations is called a
<tt>slotmap</tt>.  A <defn>frame</defn> is an OID whose value in the
object database is a slotmap.  Using OIDs allows different programs
and databases to keep separate references to a frame while managing to
share changes and augmentations.

<P>Operations on slots include getting their value(s), adding a value,
removing a value, and checking whether they contain a particular
value.  The value may be non-deterministic (a choice), in which case
we may refer to the <em>values</em> of the slot.

<P>When the slotid is a symbol, operations on the value of the slot
are just operations on the slot's data.  Getting the slot's value
retrieves the slot data and adding a value to a slot adds an element
to the slot's data (which is represented as a non-deterministic
value).  Except for this last point, frames whose slotids are symbols
function much as property lists of symbols in languages like LISP or
associative arrays in Perl.  (From a computational standpoint,
slotmaps are not a very efficient way to store large numbers of
associations.  For that, it is better to use a hashtable or an
external index.)

<P>When the slotid is itself a frame (i.e. an OID whose value is a
slotmap), operations on the slot are more complicated.  Instead of
just operating on the slot's data, operations evaluate methods for
computing or testing for values, adding or removing elements, or
checking that the given frames or values are correct.  The methods are
expressions in FDScript, the FramerD scripting language, which can
access the variables frame, slotid, data, and value which contain the
details of the particular slot and (when appropriate) the value being
added, removed, or tested for.  The expressions are stored in the
following slots of the slotid:
<ul>
<LI><tt>GET-METHODS</tt> evaluated to get the value of the slot
<LI><tt>TEST-METHODS</tt> evaluated to determine whether or not the slot has
a particular value; the slot "has a value" whenever any of these
methods returnst true.
<LI><tt>VALIDATE-METHODS</tt> evaluated whenever a value is added to a slot; an
error is signalled (and the value is not added) whenever any of these
methods returns false.
<LI><tt>ADD-EFFECTS</tt> evaluated whenever a new value is added to a slot
<LI><tt>REMOVE-EFFECTS</tt> evaluated whenever a value is removed from a slot
</ul>

<P>Methods can operate on slots of the same or other frames and
normally this simply invokes the corresponding methods, except when
this is likely to recur infinitely.  This can occur when the inference
relations between slots are implicitly circular.  For example, slots
describing the width, height, and area of a rectangle might be defined
in terms of one another.  However, this could lead to an infinite
recursion if, for instance, by the following path:
<ul>
<li>To know the area of X, figure out the width and height of X</li>
<li>To know the width of X, figure out the area and height of X</li>
<li>To know the area of X, figure out the width and height of X....</li>
</ul>
<P>To avoid this recursion, operations on a complex slots always check
whether an identical operation (getting the same slot, adding,
removing, or testing for the same value) is already being performed.
If it is already being performed, the recursive operation either:
<ul>
<LI>returns the empty set (for getting a value)
<LI>returns false (for testing for a value)
<LI>does nothing (for adding or removing a value)
</ul>
<P>This allows slots to freely refer to one another without concern
for infinite recursion.  

<H2>Getting at Frames from FDScript</H2>

<P>The procedure <TT>FRAME-CREATE</TT> creates a frame and requires
specifying a <var>pool</var> in which the frame's OID will be
allocated.  The value returned by <tt>FRAME-CREATE</tt> is this OID.
If the pool argument is <tt>#f</tt> (false), a raw slotmap (rather
than an OID whose value is a slotmap) is returned.  All of the frame
procedures will take a raw slotmap as an argument, but the unique
identity of the slotmap will not be preserved between FramerD
sessions.

<P><font size=-1>This is a subtle but important point.  If you save a
raw slotmap, subsequent changes to the slotmap will not be shared.  If
you save a frame (an OID whose value is a slotmap), subsequent changes
will be changed.  In general, it is important to use frames for
descriptions which may persist beyond the current session.</font>

<P>In addition to the pool argument, <tt>frame-create</tt> takes a
number of other arguments.  If it is given one argument, it should be
a slotmap to which the corresponding OID's value is initialized.  If
it is given more than one argument, they are intepreted as a series of
slots and values initially assigned to the frame, e.g.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (frame-create "temp@framerd.org"
              'obj-name "test" 'test-slot 'test-value
              'another-test-slot "another-value")
@a/40010"test" ;&lt;- Prints out using the obj-name slot
</PRE>
<P>the slot <TT>OBJ-NAME</TT> is used by FDScript when displaying the
frame's OID, as you can see in the printed value above.

<P>The procedure <TT>FGET</TT> extracts a slot from a frame given a
slotid, E.G.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(fget @a/40010"test" 'test-slot)</strong>
TEST-VALUE
</PRE>
<P>When the slotid is a symbol, <TT>FGET</TT> simply retrieves whatever was
initially or subsequently stored in the slot. The rules are different when
the slotid is itself a frame, when certain inferences may happen, but we
discuss that below.

<P>The procedure <TT>FADD!</TT> adds a new value to a frame for a given
slotid, E.G.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(fadd! @a/40010"test" 'test-slot 'another-value)</strong>
[fdscript] <strong>(fget @a/40010"test" 'test-slot)</strong>
{TEST-VALUE ANOTHER-VALUE}
</PRE>
<P>A formatted description of a frame can be gotten with the procedure <TT>FDD</TT>:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (FDD @a/40010)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The frame @a/40010:
OBJ-NAME:  "test"
TEST-SLOT: (2 values)
  TEST-VALUE
  ANOTHER-VALUE
ANOTHER-TEST-SLOT:  "another-value"
@a/40010"test"
</PRE>
<P>FDD is also a command line program with the same name, so you can do <TT>fdd
</TT> (lowercase for Unix) at the shell.

<P>Since frames are OIDs, changes to frames are not permanent until
either the session exits normally or the changes are explicitly
committed. The procedures <TT>COMMIT-OID</TT>, <TT>COMMIT-POOL</TT>,
and <TT>COMMIT-POOLS</TT> all work to save changes to frames and the
additional procedure <TT>COMMIT-FRAME</TT> is just another name for
<TT>COMMIT-OID</TT>.

<P>The procedure <TT>FRAME-SLOTS</TT> returns all the slotids associated
with a frame, E.G.
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (frame-slots @a/40010)
{obj-name test-slot another-test-slot}
</PRE>
<P>For example, The following code converts a frame into an
association list (i.e. a list of key value pairs):
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (define (get-alist-entry unit slotid)
             (cons slotid (set->list (frame-get unit slotid))))
[fdscript] (define (frame-&gt;alist frame)
             (set->list (get-alist-entry frame (frame-slots frame))))
(frame->alist @a/40010)
((ANOTHER-TEST-SLOT "another-value") 
 (TEST-SLOT ANOTHER-VALUE TEST-VALUE)
 (OBJ-NAME "test"))
</PRE>

<H2>Inferences over slots</H2>

<P>When a slotid is another frame, procedures like <TT>fget</TT> and
<TT>fadd!</TT> act a little differently based on the slots of that
frame. Each operation has a special slot associated with it and that
slot contains a set of FDScript expressions which may be evaluated
when the operation is performed:
<CENTER><TABLE PAD=5>
<TR><TH>OPERATION<TH>SLOT<TH>VARIABLES BOUND
<TR><TD>fget<TD>GET-METHODS<TD><TT><B>frame, slotid, data</B></TT>

<TR><TD>fzap!<TD>ZAP-EFFECTS<TD><B><TT>frame, slotid, data, value</TT></B>
</TABLE></CENTER>
when these values are evaluated, certain variables are bound:
<DL>
<DT><TT>frame</TT><DD>is bound to the frame being operated upon
<DT><TT>slotid</TT><DD>is bound to the slot being operated upon
<DT><TT>data</TT><DD>is bound to primitive values associated with the slotid

</DL>
<P>allowing the procedure to compute extra values, make additional changes,
or notify users of changes. For instance, the following definition..
<PRE class=typescript>

             'obj-name "n-hyponyms"
             'get-methods (set-size (GET frame 'hyponyms)))

of the application or even of other applications.  Changes are not
visible at once, however; an application must explicitly
<em>commit</em> its changes to make them persistent and shared.

<P>Because indices are persistent, they are typically used as
resources by programs and may represent the accumulation of results
from many computations and many different processes.  A suite of
applications may have a set of indices which they share and update.

<H2>Indices are demand-driven</H2>

<P CLASS="first">
When an application uses an index, it normally only uses resources for
a fraction of the index.  The rest of the index is maintained --- on a
remote server or in the file system --- for when it is needed.  When
neccessary, it goes to the server or file and retrieves the needed
mappings.  A quite small application can access a huge index through
this method.

<P>FramerD has two sorts of built-in indices.  File indices store
mappings in a file on a local or remote disk and retrieve mappings by
random access in the file.  Network indices use a simple protocol to
access DType servers which provide mappings to their clients.  These
two types are interchangable.

<H2>Indices are incremental</H2>

<P CLASS="first">
Indices are designed to efficiently support incremental changes.
In particular, it is supposed to be efficient to both add new values
to existing keys and to add initial values to new keys.  This makes
index files useful for storing <em>inverted indices</em> used in many
information retrieval applications.  It is also easy to get the
<em>number</em> of values associated with a particular key, which is
important for certain kinds of statistical retrieval algorithms.

<P>Indices also cache values in two directions.  When an index goes to
a file or server to get a mapping, it caches the result locally so
that a subsequent request can proceed much faster.  For this reason,
some FramerD applications may speed up over time as they cache
commonly referenced index keys.

<P>When an index is modified, the modifications are stored locally
with the application making the modifications.  Only when the index is
<em>committed</em> do the changes go into the files on disk or across
the network.  

<H2>Indices can index objects</H2>

<P CLASS="first">
Indices are the basis of a general object indexing facility.  This
uses the convention that keys of the form: <tt>(slot . value)</tt>
refer to frames whose <tt>slot</tt> contains <tt>value</tt>.  For
example, the key <tt>(year-of-birth . 1961)</tt> would be associated
with all the frames whose <tt>year-of-birth</tt> slot was
<tt>1961</tt>.  These indices can be used to find frames with
particular properties or combinations of properties as well as for
more flexible "fuzzy" searches.

<H2>Using indices from FDScript</H2>

<P>Indices are accessed by the function <B><TT>USE-INDEX</TT></B>:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(USE-INDEX "/local/test-index")</strong>
[#INDEX "/local/test-index"]
</PRE>
<P>which can also take a network server specification, as in:
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] <strong>(USE-INDEX "testi@somehost")</strong>
[#INDEX "testi@somehost"]
</PRE>
<P>The functions for accessing an index are just like the functions for
accessing a hashtable:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="INDEX-GET">
    (INDEX-GET <VAR>index</VAR> <VAR>key</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>gets the values associated with <VAR>key</VAR> in <VAR>index</VAR>.
<DT><B><TT> <A NAME="INDEX-ADD!">
    (INDEX-ADD! <VAR>index</VAR> <VAR>key</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>adds <VAR>new</VAR> to the values associated with <VAR>key</VAR> in <VAR>index</VAR>.
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="INDEX-SET!">
    (INDEX-SET! <VAR>index</VAR> <VAR>key</VAR> <VAR>new</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>makes <VAR>new</VAR> be the only value associated with <VAR>key</VAR> in
<VAR>index</VAR>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="INDEX-ZAP!">
    (INDEX-ZAP! <VAR>index</VAR> <VAR>key</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>ensures that no values will be associated with <VAR>key</VAR> in
<VAR>index</VAR>. </DD>

<DT><B><TT><A NAME="INDEX-KEYS">(INDEX-KEYS <VAR>index</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>returns all of the keys stored in an index.
</DL>
<P>Changes to indices are like changes to pools in that they need to be
<B>committed</B> to be permanent. Changes are committed automatically
if the FDScript session exits normally. Changes can also be committed
manually:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="COMMIT-INDEX">(COMMIT-INDEX <VAR>index</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>saves the changes made all the keys in <VAR>index</VAR>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="COMMIT-INDICES">(COMMIT-INDICES)</A></TT></B>
<DD>saves the changes made to all the keys in all of the indices
</DL>
<P>As with pools, changes to indices can be <VAR>reverted</VAR>:
<DL>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="REVERT-INDEX">(REVERT-INDEX <VAR>index</VAR>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>removes all the changes made to keys in <VAR>index</VAR>.</DD>

<DT><B><TT><A NAME="REVERT-INDICES">(REVERT-INDICES)</A></TT></B>
<DD>removes all the changes made to keys in all indices.</DD>
</DL>
<P>As with pools, changes cannot be reverted once they are committed and
reversion applies only to the associations in the index and not to
other relations involving the keys or values.

<H2>File indices</H2>

<P CLASS="first">
There are a number of special functions for dealing with file indices.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="make-file-index">
    (make-file-index <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>minsize</VAR>)</A></TT></B></DT>
<DD>Creates a new file index in the file <VAR>filename</VAR> that contains
at least <VAR>minsize</VAR> slots. Note that file indices have a fixed
size and need to be explicitly grown using maintenance tools built
into FDScript or available from the command prompt. This is because
growing a file index with millions of keys can be very time consuming
and couldn't be "transparent" even if you wanted it to be. <A
NAME="cache-index"></A>
<DT><B><TT>(cache-index <VAR>index</VAR>)</TT></B></DT>

<DD>When <VAR>index</VAR> is a file index, this keeps a copy of the files
offset table in memory, which improves access time by avoiding one
disk seek.  This is especially useful when disk seeks are particularly
slow (for instance with CD-ROM drives).

<DT><B><TT><A NAME="auto-cache-file-indices">
    (auto-cache-file-indices)</A></TT></B>
<DD>Arranges for file indices to be automatically cached when
referenced. This is a good idea for programs which do a lot of index
accesses or for speed when the index file is on a slow device (such as
a CD-ROM or network disk).
</DL>

<P>In addition, there are several command line utilities for dealing
with file indices:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>make-file-index <VAR>filename</VAR> <VAR>minsize</VAR></TT>
<DD>Creates a file index with (at least) a particular size.
<DT><TT>analyze-index <VAR>filename</VAR> --keys | --values | --stats</TT>
<DD>Returns information about the index file in <VAR>filename</VAR>. The
options can be combined and have the following interpretation:
<UL>
<L><TT>--stats</TT> reports hashtable statistics (number of keys, average
and max misses per key, most common keys, etc)
<LI><TT>--keys</TT> lists all of the keys with the number of values
for each
<LI><TT>--values</TT> lists all of the values
</UL>
With no arguments, <TT>analyze-index</TT> simply prints the number of
slots in the index.
</DL>
<P>File indices have standard sizes at roughly powers of 2 and user specified
sizes are rounded up to the nearest standard size.

<P>FramerD builds an object indexing facility on top of the general
association facility described above. <DFN><B>Indexing</DFN></B> a
frame stores inverse pointers from its properties to the frame. This
allows the frame to be found later based on a set of properties or to
find objects similar (i.e. with common properties) to one particular
frame.

<P>There are three main ways of indexing frames:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="index-frame">
    (index-frame <I>index</I> <I>frame</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>Indexes all the properties actually stored on <I>frame</I> in

<DD>Indexes frame as having SLOT with VALUE (whether it does or not).
</DL>
<P>Once a frame has been indexed, one can search for it either strictly ---
based on certain combinations of slots and values --- or "fuzzily" based
on similarity to an instance or set of instances.

<H2>Strict Searching</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><I>I'll have the french onion soup, without the cheese

the green salad with honey-mustard dressing on the side,<BR>

<P>Strict searching uses the <I>FIND-FRAMES</I> procedure:
<PRE class=typescript>
(find-frames <I>index</I> 
   <I>slot<SUB>1</SUB></I> <I>value<SUB>1</SUB></I>
   ... <I>slot<SUB>n</SUB></I> <I>value<SUB>n</SUB></I>)
</PRE>
<P>which finds all objects that have all the specified slots and values. If
any of the <I>value<SUB>i</SUB></I> are non-deterministic sets, the slot
need only have one of the specified values, allowing some variations. For
example, in the WordNet database, the expression:
<PRE class=typescript>

{@1/31813"VERB.COMPETITION synset for hack and kick_on_the_arm"

<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (find-frames "brico@framerd.org" 'words "hack" 'words "chop")
@1/31c3d"VERB.CONTACT synset for chop and hack"
</PRE>
<P>finds only the synsets containing both the words "hack" and
"chop". One way to think about this visually, is the search performed
by <TT>find-frames</TT> is conjunctive horizontally (along the list of
arguments) and disjunctive vertically (within each argument).

<H2>Fuzzy Searching</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right>
<I>I'll have a burger with fries and a chocolate shake.</I><BR>
Harry in <B>When Harry met Sally</B></DIV>

<P>A fuzzy search does not require an exact match, but returns the
best possible match measured by the number of overlapping
properties. There are a variety of fuzzy search functions as well as a
set of tools for writing your own fuzzy search routines.  The chief
function find-best, looks just like find-frames:
<PRE class=typescript>
(find-frames <I>index</I> 
   <I>slot<SUB>1</SUB></I> <I>value<SUB>1</SUB></I>
   ... <I>slot<SUB>n</SUB></I> <I>value<SUB>n</SUB></I>)
</pre>
<P>but returns those objects with the largest number of matching
properties.

<H2>Similarity Searching</H2>

<DIV ALIGN=right><I>I'll have what she's having.</I><BR>
from <B>When Harry Met Sally</B></DIV>

<P>One of the most powerful search mechanisms in FramerD and FDscript
is "similarity searching" which begins with an object or set of
objects and finds objects which have the same properties as those
objects, weighting as higher those which are more in common among the
set of initial descriptions.
<DL>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="find-similar">
    (find-similar <I>indices</I> <I>frame</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>Returns the frames indexed in <I>indices</I> which have the most
number of slot values in common with <I>frame</I>.</DD>
<DT><B><TT><A NAME="find-similar">
    (find-similar <I>indices</I> <I>frame</I><I>slots</I>)</A></TT></B>
<DD>limits the search for similarity to <I>slots</I>.  Returns the frames
indexed in <I>indices</I> which have the most number of slot values in
common with <I>frame</I>.</DD>
</DL>
<P>For example, the following search finds words with similar meanings to
the common sense of "hack" and "chop":
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (find-similar "brico@framerd.org"
             @1/31c3d"VERB.CONTACT synset for chop and hack")
{@1/31be9"VERB.CONTACT synset for shave, trim, and cut_closely" 
 @1/31c3f"VERB.CONTACT synset for chop, chop_up, and cut_into_pieces" 
 @1/31e95"VERB.CONTACT synset for mow and cut_down" 
 @1/325d4"VERB.CONTACT synset for rebate and cut_a_rebate_in" 
 @1/325d7"VERB.CONTACT synset for saw and cut_with_a_saw"}
</PRE>
<B>Fuzzy searching and non-determinism.</B> When the <I>frame</I>
argument to <TT>find-similar</TT> is non-deterministic, the search
mechanism does a single search but uses features from each of the
frames in combination.  As a consequence, the search weighs properties
common between the frames more heavily. For example, in this
retrieval,
<PRE class=typescript>
[fdscript] (find-similar "brico@framerd" 
             (amb @1/31c3f"VERB.CONTACT synset for chop, chop_up, and cut_into_pieces" 
                  @1/31e95"VERB.CONTACT synset for mow and cut_down"))</strong>
@1/31c3d"VERB.CONTACT synset for chop and hack"
</PRE>
<P>the properties common to the two synsets selects the search pattern which
put them together in the first place.

<a name="dtypes">
<TABLE class="header" width=100% cellpadding=0>
<TR><TH class="title">The DTYPE Protocol</TH>
    <TD class="gloss">DTypes are a binary data format and communications
protocol underlying FramerD.  DTypes allow the storage and transmission
of complex recursively structured objects.  DTypes can be extended to encode
application-specific data while still using generic facilities for
storage and search.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</a>
<HR>
<P>DTypes are a portable data representation used throughout the
FramerD suite of libraries, tools, and applications.  There are two
basic levels to the DType representation: a minimal set of "core data
types" and an extensible external binary representation for those
types and their extensions.  Applications and libraries use and extend
the native data types, taking advantage of communication, persistence,
and indexing facilities which use the external representation.

<P>DTypes differ from other data sharing approaches in not depending
on explicit data declarations for sharing complex structures.
Distributed processing models like CORBA rely on shared data
declarations for communicating complex data structures.  DTypes allow
a `sloppier' approach where basic data types include nested and
labelled heterogenous structures.  This allows for fast prototyping of
applications and protocols as well as their on-line extension.

<P>The minimal set of native types include fixed and floating point
numbers, ASCII strings and symbols, vectors and pair structures.  It
also includes some special types, especially the OID (Object
IDentifier) pointers used by the FramerD object database.  The
external binary representation is used in three primary ways:
<ul>
<li>in communicating among clients and servers
using a remote procedure call protocol;</li>

<li>in storing the values associated global "Object IDentifiers"
(OIDs) by FramerD's <A HREF="odb.html">object database</A>;</li>

<li>in associating structured objects to one another through <A
HREF="indices.html">FramerD indices</A>.</li>
</ul>

<P>The DType core representation includes the following types:
<ul>
<li>literal constants for truth, falsity, the empty list, and a void value
<li>small signed integers (32 bits)
<li>limited precision floating point numbers (again, 32 bits)
<li>ASCII strings
<li>Symbols ("interned" ascii strings)
<li>Pairs (of any two other types, which can be composed into lists)
<li>Vectors (of any mixture of types)
<li>Packets (arbitrary vectors of bytes)
<li>OIDs (object identifiers) identifying in a virtual 64-bit address space
<li>Exceptions and Errors (representing unusual conditions)
</ul>

<P>Native applications can provide their own types and use FramerD
storage and indexing facilities by implementing extensions to the
external binary representation for their types.  These extensions can
either be in the form of compounds or package types.

<P>A compound representation consists of a type name (a tag) and a
"canonical form" which can be used to identify and regenerate the
object.  Logically, neither the tag nor the the canonical form can
include the object being described or else the translation would recur
indefinitely.

<P>A packaged representation consists of a two byte type code followed by
1 or 4 bytes of size information and some amount of additional data.
The value of the first byte identifies a "package" for the extension;
the value of the second byte (which is defined by the package
maintainer) specifies a more precise type code and also specifies the
format of the subsequent data in a fashion which FramerD facilities
can manipulate without interpreting.

<P>The core FramerD libraries introduce new datatypes with packaged data
representations for:
<ul>
<li><strong>choices</strong> used to represent
unordered sets of alternative results and values
<li><strong>slotmaps</strong> providing simple associations between
keys and values 
<li>various <strong>numerical types</strong>, including:
<ul>
<li>arbitrary precision integers</li>
<li>rational numbers</li>
<li>complex numbers</li>
</ul>
<li>extended <strong>character types</strong>, including:
<ul>
<li>unicode and ascii characters</li>
<li>unicode strings</li>
<li>unicode symbols (interned unicode strings)</li>
</ul>
