<TD class='aboutcontent'><strong>FramerD</strong> is a
portable distributed object-oriented database designed to support the
maintenance and sharing of knowledge bases.  Unlike other
object-oriented databases, FramerD is optimized for the sort of
<em>pointer-intensive</em> data structures used by semantic networks,
frame systems, and many intelligent agent applications.  FramerD
databases readily include millions of searchable frames and may be
distributed over multiple networked machines.  FramerD includes an
extensive scripting language based on <strong>Scheme</strong> with
special support for web-based interfaces.<BR>
<strong>FramerD</strong> is implemented in ANSI C and has been
compiled for a wide range of platforms, including many varieties of
Unix and WIn32.  In addition, experimental Java and Lisp libraries
exist for accessing FramerD databases and services.</TD></TR>

<TD class='aboutcontent'>
<strong>FramerD</strong> is designed for incremental and
collaborative data and knowledge base development.  One primary cause
of brittleness, incompatability, and obsolesence in advanced
applications is the premature codification of structures, protocols,
and semantics.  FramerD was designed to provide robust and efficient
data management <em>without</em> extensive up-front specification of
data and operations.  Developed at MIT's Media Laboratory, FramerD has
been used for four years in developing information access and machine
understanding applications.<BR>
<strong>FramerD</strong> sources and platform releases are
available <em>free of charge</em> under the <A HREF="GPL.text">GNU
GPL</A>.  Inquiries about less restrictive commercial licenses should
be directed to MIT's Technology Licensing Office.

<strong>FramerD</strong> was originally developed at <A
HREF="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</A>'s <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu/">Media
Laboratory</A> by Ken Haase.  The laboratory's support, especially from its <A
HREF="http://nif.www.media.mit.edu/">News In the Future</A> program, is
gratefully acknowledged.  The primary development of FramerD is currently
supported by <A HREF="http://www.beingmeta.com/">beingmeta</A>, a developer of
next-generation content and knowledge management tools.
<BR><strong>In addition</strong>, the community of FramerD developers
has been generous with their time and attention.  The most recent
release of FramerD, 2.3, owes a great deal to <strong>Ralph
Campbell</strong>, <strong>Matthew Fredette</strong>, and <strong>Tim
Chklovski</strong> in particular.  <em>Thanks!</em>
<BR>FramerD development is currently hosted by <A
HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A> which hosts and
supports FramerD and numerous other open-source projects.  </TD></TR>
