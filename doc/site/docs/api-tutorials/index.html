    <h1>FramerD C API Tutorials</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the FramerD C API Tutorials. This set of documents
      should get you started with programming FramerD at the lowest
      levels, and give you the familiarity you need to spelunk the
      source code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that I've written these tutorials "as you go",
      during my own exploration of the FramerD system. Thus, they
      reflect my personal choices and focuses. If there are things
      you'd like to see covered, or more thoroughly covered, <a
      href="mailto:tripp.lilley@perspex.com">drop me a line</a> and
      I'll let you know if I've the cycles. Of course, feel free to
      send patches, corrections, and additional tutorials.
    </p>


    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than intersperse setup/configuration steps in the
      tutorials themselves, I've chosen to consolidate the various
      setup steps in the <a href="test-server-setup.html">Test Server
	Setup</a> document. This situation may change as these
      tutorials take shape, but for now, look to that document for
      setup steps that need to occur before each tutorial.
    </p>


    <h2>Tutorials</h2>
    <p>
      The tutorials themselves start from the very simple, and evolve
      as we go along. Links and short descriptions to each tutorial
      follow:
