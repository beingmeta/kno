FramerD 2.0 is now available in a stable beta version.  FramerD 2.0
provides:
  * an internationalized Scheme implementation (FDScript) with support
for Unicode in both programs and data
  * a robust object store and index designed to support very large
(> 10^6 nodes) pointer-intensive distributed databases
  * built-in support for *non-deterministic programming* allowing
the perspicuous expression of search and set operations
  * a rich library of text matching, analysis, and rewriting functions
including parsers for MIME-encoded messages, XML, and HTML
  * the ability to divide processing and data among lightweight servers
distributed across multiple machines
  * operating system access functions useful for command line scripting,
including interaction with other programs through sockets or pipes
