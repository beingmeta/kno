<A HREF="http://www.framerd.org/">FramerD</A> 2.4 is now available for Unix, Win32, and OS X.</P>

<P class=newsbody><A HREF="http://www.beingmeta.com/">beingmeta</A> is
delighted to announce the GPL release of <A
HREF="http://www.framerd.org/">FramerD</A> 2.4, a knowledge
development and application platform for Unix, Win32, and OS X.  This
new release can be <A HREF="/download.html">downloaded</A> from
<A HREF="sf.net">SourceForge</A>.</P>

<P class=newsbody><STRONG>FramerD</STRONG> is a robust and scalable
object database especially designed and optimized for
pointer-intensive semi-structured data with complex or evolving data
models.  FramerD includes full support for Unicode in both data and
programs together with powerful tools for <A
HREF="/docs/fdscript-guide.html#text">text processing</A> and
linguistic analysis.  These can be accessed through <A
HREF="/docs/fdscript-guide.html">FDScript</A>, a version of Scheme
which includes language-level support for <A
HREF="/docs/fdscript-guide.html#choices">non-deterministic</A>
(Prolog-style) programming and <A
HREF="/docs/fdscript-guide.html#threads">multi-threaded</A>
applications.</P>

<P class=newsbody>FramerD natively supports reading and and generation
of XML, HTML, and MIME data.  <A HREF="/docs/www-guide.html">Web
services</A> support in FramerD has long included built-in facilities
for processing CGI requests both directly and through the persistent
FastCGI protocol.  With version 2.4, FramerD comes with <A
HREF="/docs/www-guide.html#fdserv">mod_fdserv</A>, a lightweight
extension to the Apache webserver for transparently managing
persistent multi-threaded servlets (written in FDScript) responding to
CGI requests.</P>

<P class=newsbody>FramerD is implemented in ANSI/POSIX standard C, and
can be directly accessed from either compiled code, FramerD's
scripting language, or the system command line.  FramerD data can also
be accessed from Java using a class library also available under the
GPL.  Work is underway in the open-source community on Python bindings
to the FramerD libraries.</P>

<P class=newsbody>FramerD was originally developed at the MIT Media Laboratory as a
platform for large scale knowledge representation and media content
description.  After a decade of development and internal use, MIT
released FramerD 2.2 under the LGPL in 2001 as active development work
moved to beingmeta, inc.</P>

<P class=newsbody><STRONG>beingmeta, inc.</STRONG> [<A
HREF="http://www.beingmeta.com/">website</A>] is a new company
developing infrastructure, resources, and applications for
knowledge-rich content and knowledge management.</P>

<P class=newsbody>Developers are encouraged to join the work on FramerD; the current
wish list includes:
<UL>
<LI class=newsbody>translations of the FramerD message catalogs into other languages</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>FDScript bindings for the remaining standard POSIX library functions</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>FDScript bindings to the major windowing toolkits  (GTK &amp; QT)</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>FDScript bindings for ODBC to allow FramerD to access SQL databases </LI>
<LI class=newsbody>someone to help with maintaining and extending the WIN32 port (based on MINGW)</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>someone to update the Common Lisp library for FramerD to the latest version of FramerD and the latest versions of Common Lisp</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>someone to take the lead on the Java-based FramerD libraries</LI>
<LI class=newsbody>more documentation, especially tutorials and example programs</LI>
</UL></P>

<P class=newsbody>The primary support for FramerD development is based
at beingmeta inc., an early-stage startup developing semantically rich
knowledge and content management solutions based on a variety of
technologies including FramerD.  beingmeta is committed to FramerD
remaining an open-source technology developed by a heterogenous
community and released under the GPL.  The final MIT version of
FramerD, FramerD 2.2, has been officially released under the LGPL and
is available at <A
