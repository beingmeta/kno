    <h1>FramerD C API Tutorials Test Server Setup</h1>

    <p>
      This document takes you step-by-step through building the
      FramerD pools and data you'll use in the programming
      tutorials. The document is divided up into pre-tutorial setup
      (that you'll need to do before you begin the tutorial), and
      steps to be performed in preparation for each tutorial
      step. Thus, you will continually refer to this document
      throughout the tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though the tutorial itself focuses on programming FramerD
      through the C API, you'll use FDScript and the command-line
      tools included with FramerD extensively in these setup steps.
    </p>



    <h2>Pre-Tutorial Setup</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>Creating the File Pool</h3>
    <p>
      The very first thing you have to do is create an initial pool
      with some very simple data that you'll access through the
      FramerD C API. Use the <code>make-file-pool</code> tool to do
      this:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>make-file-pool tutorial.pool 32768</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This creates a file in the current directory called
      <i>tutorial.pool</i>, which contains a FramerD pool with a
      capacity of 32768 OIDs. Note that the capacity specified must be
      a power of two. If it is not, FramerD will automatically round
      it up to the next power of two.
    </p>


    <h3>Serving the File Pool Over the Network</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you've created the file pool, you have to run fdserver
      against it so that it's shared and available to network
      clients. The simplest way to accomplish this is by invoking
      fdserver with the server name and the pool name, but it doesn't
      work (see below). Here's the command as it <i>should</i> be, but 
      don't bother typing it in:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>fdserver atut --pool tutorial.pool</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This shares the pool contained in the file <i>tutorial.pool</i>
      as server <i>atut@host</i>, where <i>host</i> is the hostname of
      your machine. Note that, unless overridden, this will share on
      port 2888, which is derived from <i>atut</i> using <a
      href="touch-tone-encoding.html"><i>touch-tone
      encoding</i></a>. If you wish to use a different port, specify
      it in place of the string <i>atut</i> on the fdserver command
      line. You may either specify another string to be touch-tone
      encoded, or a number to be taken literally. Note that if you
      specify a number, you will need to refer to that server as
      <i>port@host</i> instead of <i>name@host</i>, since there is no
      server "name" per se (server "names" are simply used to generate
      port numbers internally, and have no real meaning).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as mentioned above, this doesn't seem to work as
      expected. There seems to be a subtle bug in fdserver that causes
      it to seg fault if you invoke the server without a configuration
      file, on a port that's different than the one implied by the
      base filename of the pool file. Thus, <code><i>fdserver fred
      --pool fred.pool</i></code> would work, but <code><i>fdserver
      frood --pool fred.pool</i></code> wouldn't. I'm not up to
      patching the sources right now, but I have a workaround for you,
      which is necessary if you wish to use the names as I've used
      them in the tutorials:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, create an initialization file for fdserver called
      <i>atut.fdx</i>, that contains the following:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pre>
(serve-pool "tutorial.pool")
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, invoke fdserver with this command line:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <code>fdserver atut</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      What happens here is that fdserver looks for the file
      <i>atut.fdx</i> before it does anything else. Finding that file, 
      it executes the 'initialization' commands contained therein. The 
      only command (<code><i>(serve-pool "tutorial.pool")</i></code>)
      tells fdserver to serve the pool file <i>tutorial.pool</i>, and
      nothing else. fdserver takes its port number from the string
      "atut", specified on the command line. The end result is what we 
      intended with the original command line.
    </p>

    
      


    <a anchor="pool-get.c">
    <h2>pool-get.c Tutorial Setup</h2>
    </a>

    <h3>Connecting to the Pool Server</h3>
    <p>
      In preparation for pool-get.c, you'll need to add an OID to your 
      pool, and give it some data. Invoke fdscript with no arguments,
      and you should see the banner and prompt:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pre>
[02:08:24 MIT FramerD library 1.0 (c) 1994-1999, built Jun  6 1999]
*[fdscript]
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, connect to the tutorial pool using the use-pool command:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pre>
*[fdscript] (use-pool "atut@host")
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>host</i> is your hostname, and <i>atut</i> should reflect
      whatever value you used as the server/port name when starting
      fdserver above.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output of this command will be a session information banner, 
      along with some miscellaneous status, similar to this:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pre>
[02:47:50 Session id=fdscript tlilley@defiant /PID:1932 /OS:i686-unknown-linux /Compiled:Jun  6 1999 /Started:Mon Jun  7 02:47:50 1999]
[02:47:50 Added pool atut@defiant]
[#POOL atut@defiant @375ae87e/20020+32768 {}]
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code><i>#POOL</i></code> status line reports the super-pool 
      half of the OID (375ae87e), the base offset within the
      super-pool of this pool (20020), and the capacity of the pool
      (32768). Pay attention to these numbers, as we'll need them
      later in the tutorial.
    </p>


    <h3>Allocating an OID</h3>
    <p>
      Now you'll need to allocate an OID from the pool to which you're 
      connected. In the fdscript listener, enter:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>(allocate-oid "atut@host")</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      fdscript will return a response line that simply contains the
      new OID, like so:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pre>
@/atut/0
    </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this expression is a <i>logical</i> OID. You can tell
      this by the forward-slash immediately following the initial at
      ('@') sign. By simply adding the super-pool OID, the base offset
      of this pool, and the logical part of this OID, we can compute
      the literal OID. For this example, based on our
      <code><i>#POOL</i></code> output discussed above, the literal
      OID is <code>@375ae87e/20020</code>. For more details on literal
      and logical OIDs, and conversions between them, see <a
      href="../odb.html">The Object Database</a>. Not also that, in
      properly written FramerD programs, you can use literal and
      logical OIDs interchangably (see the note in <a
      href="pool-get.c.html#use_pool">pool-get.c</a> for an
      explanation of what "properly written" means, and why it
      matters).
    </p>


    <h3>Assigning a Value to an OID</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you've created an OID, you need to assign a simple
      string value to it for our testing:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>(set-oid-value! @/atut/0 "simple value")</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The fdserver listener will report <code><i>;; No return value
	  expected</i></code>, since the value set function doesn't
      return anything. To double-check that the value was set as you
      expected, enter this command at the listener prompt:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>(oid-value @/atut/0)</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The system should report <code><i>"simple value"</i></code>, as
      we expect. Finally, commit the changes to the pool (even though
      fdserver will commit if it exits normally) with this command:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <code>(commit-pools)</code>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      That's it! You're now ready to proceed with the <a
	href="pool-get.c.html">pool-get.c</a> introductory tutorial.
    </p>
