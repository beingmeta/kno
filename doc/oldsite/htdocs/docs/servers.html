<P>If the <A HREF="concepts.html#dtypes">DType protocol</A> is the glue of
complex FramerD applications, servers are their struts and skeleton.  Both
FramerD data (pools of OIDs), annotations (indices), general services (natural
language parsing, associative searching), and application services (parsing of
particular formats, management of shared state) can be and often are
modularized into FramerD servers.</P>

<P>In addition to encouraging modular design, the packaging of
functions into servers allows computation and data to be distributed
according to the diversity of resources and demand.  The portability
of FramerD's C kernel (from low end PCs and notebooks to
multiple-processor production servers) permits processing to be
arranged with respect to available processing, memory, and long term
storage resources.  The accessibility of servers from very lightweight
DType clients permits point-of-interaction applications which can
leverage very complex remote processing.</P>

<P>For instance, a FramerD application can consist of a 30K java
applet on a palmtop accessing a server on a nearby PC connecting to a
distant high-throughput function server on the outside of a firewall
which synthesizes results from knowledge bases provided by several
high-performance database servers on the inside of the firewall.  And
this may be only one path of connectivity between these servers and
services!  Other applications or services may connect these components
in different ways.</P>

<P>A FramerD server is essentially a remote Scheme evaluator which processes
expressions and returns values.  This evaluator typically processes a variant
of the Scheme language, reduced (in some ways) to enhance security and extended
(in other ways) to provide particular functionality.  For example, servers do
not usually provide direct access to the local file system or to other servers.
However, most servers do provide special functions, which can range from
managing object persistence to processing natural language to serving as
special gateways to other network services.</P>

<P>In distributed FramerD applications, two special kinds of servers
are OID servers and index servers:
<ul>
<li><strong>OID servers</strong> provide access to the persistent object
database by offering retrieval and (possibly) modification for a range of
OIDs (object identifiers)</li>
<li><strong>Index servers</strong> provide associational indices from
complex structured <em>keys</em> to sets of OIDs or other objects.</li>
</li>
</ul>
<P>FramerD servers are nearly always implemented by the executable
<tt>fdserver</tt> and configured by use of a <em>server control
file</em> described below.</P>


<H2><a name=simple>Simple Servers</a></H2>

<P>The simplest way to start a new server is to use a <em>server
control file</em> as the single argument to the program
<tt>fdserver</tt>.  A server control file typically has a name of the
form <em>name<tt>.fdz</tt></em> and consists of FDScript code which is
processed to initialize the server.  Unless overriden, the server
evaluates the forms in the control file and then starts listening for
remote requests at a particular <em>port name</em>.  This port name
can either be set in the control file (by the function
<tt>set-port-id!</tt>) or will be derived from the control file's
<em>name</em>.  The port name is converted into a port number (what
the network really uses) using either a system-wide database of
service names (often found in /etc/services under Unix) or by
<em>touch-tone encoding</em> (so "brico" corresponds to the port
27425).</P>

<P>The server control file is simply an FDScript file which
initializes the pools, indices, and procedures which the server will
provide.  Applications or components can be bundled with canned ".fdz"
files for setting up a local version of the specified data or
processing servers.</P>

<P>For example, the Brico knowledge base comes bundled with the file
<tt>brico.fdz</tt>:
<blockquote><pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdserver
;;; This is the file brico.fdz

(set-port-id! "brico")

;; Just run locally if the file use-localhost exists in
;;  the same directory as this file
(when (file-exists? (get-component "use-localhost"))
  (use-localhost!))

(when (bound? ADMIN-SERVER)
  (use-pool ADMIN-SERVER)
  (use-index ADMIN-SERVER))

;;; Intialize brico server
(define brico-pool (use-pool (get-component "brico.pool")))
(define brico-index (use-index (get-component "brico.index")))
(define cyc-pool (use-pool (get-component "cyc/cyc.pool")))
(define cyc-index (use-index (get-component "cyc/cyc.index")))

(serve-pool brico-pool)
(serve-index brico-index)

(serve-pool cyc-pool)
(serve-index cyc-index)

(define (find-synsets word)
  (find-frames words-index 'words word))
(define (get-synonyms x)
  (fget (find-synsets x) 'words))

(define (help)
  "This server provide the BRICO database and special functions
to access it.")

(module-export! '{get-synonyms help})
</pre></blockquote></P>

<P>which sets up the server to provide access the OID pools
<tt>brico.pool</tt> and <tt>cyc.pool</tt> and to their respective
indices as well.  Once the server is running, clients can access these
pools and indices remotely with specifications such as <tt>(use-pool
"brico@myhost")</tt>.  It will provide remote servers with access to
these pools but not (for instance, the pool and index derived from
<TT>ADMIN-SERVER</TT> (which might be used by additional procedures to
be defined later.  This homegrown <tt>brico@myhost</tt> server can be
accessed just like the <tt>brico@db.beingmeta.com</tt> server
described in <A HREF="users-guide.html">the user's guide</A>.</P>

<P>The particular call to <TT>set-port-id!</TT> in <tt>brico.fdz</tt>
is redundant in this case, since <tt>fdserver</tt> would figure it out
from the name of the configuration file.  The server will then listen
to this port on all of the addresses currently assigned to the
machine.  This can be modified by using a portid of the form
<TT><em>portname</em>@<em>host</em></TT> where the server will only
listen to the port <tt>portid</tt> on the addresses assigned to
<em>hostname</em> (which can just be a numeric IP address in dotted
decimal format, e.g. <TT>18.85.2.138</TT>).  For example,
<PRE>
(SET-PORT-ID! "brico@127.0.0.1")
</PRE>
would set the server up to listen only on the default localhost address.
</P>

<P>The example configuration file <tt>brico.fdz</tt> also defines the procedures
<TT>find-synsets</TT>, <tt>get-synonyms</tt> and <tt>help</tt>.  The
server control file implicitly creates an environment (the "server
environment") where these procedures are defined.  At the end of the
configuration file, the call to <tt>module-export!</tt> determines
which of the definitions will actually be accessible by remote
servers.  In this case, the <tt>help</tt> function and the
<tt>get-synonyms</tt> function are available and can be called
thus:</P>
<blockquote>
<pre><font size=-1>
% dtcall brico@myhost get-synonyms "example"
"good_example"
"model"
"example"
"exemplar"
"exercise"
"instance"
"specimen"
"sample"
"quotation"
"representative"
"illustration"
"object_lesson"
"lesson"
"deterrent_example"
"protoplast"
"module"
"ensample"
"paradigm"
</font></pre>
</blockquote>

<H2><a name=security>Security Concerns</a></H2>

<P>Running a FramerD server allows clients on the Internet to run
programs on the server's host machine, a potentially risky
proposition.  This risk is reduced in fdserver by taking advantage of
FDScript's native security model.  The design of FDScript separates
out "risky" functions --- including access to the local filesystem,
external program execution, establishment of network connections, etc
--- into a separate module.  The evaluator used by fdserver does not
have access to this module but can only access "safe" functions and
whatever functions are defined in the server configuration file(s).</P>

<P>The initialization files read by <TT>fdserver</TT> are processed in
the full FDScript environment, so the definitions they provide can
access restricted functions.  This allows an implementor to write
"safe" wrappers around system functions that remote users can
access. For instance, even though proscription of <TT>fopen</TT> keeps
anonymous clients from opening arbitrary files, a user procedure
defined in the initialization files can still open a particular file
and provide access to it.</P>

<P>The "sandbox" provided by the limited server environment provides
substantial protection, but additional levels of protection can be
provided by having the server run as a limited user.  The "identity"
of a server can be set by the <tt>SET-UID!</tt> procedure in the
server control file.  This only works when the system is originally
running as a privleged user (root under unix).  In order to avoid
inadvertently running a server as root, servers started as root will
always change their uid to the string specified by the configuration
variable <tt>FDSERVER_USER</tt> (or <TT>"nobody"</TT> it is not
defined) and will change their group id to the group specified by the
string <tt>FDSERVER_GROUP</tt> (or <TT>"nogroup"</TT> if it is not
defined).</P>

<H2><a name=control>Controlling Client Access</a></H2>

<P>If the initialization files for a server defines a <TT>CLIENT-OK?</TT>
procedure in the server environment, this is called on all client addresses
before a connection is established.  The client address will typically be in
standard `.edu' or `.com' form or as dotted decimal addresses if the symbolic
hostname cannot be determined.  For example, the following <TT>CLIENT-OK?</TT>
definition permits access only from within the MIT Media Lab domain:
<PRE>
(define (client-ok? client-addr)
  (has-suffix "media.mit.edu" client-addr))
</PRE></P>
<P>In addition, the procedure <TT>(CLIENT-ID)</TT> returns the address
of the client being served.  This allows servers to customize their
processing based on client identity.  For instance, the following
definition uses two different parser servers depending on the domain
of the client being served:
<PRE>
(define (parse string)
 (if (has-suffix ".media.mit.edu" (client-id))
     (dtcall "parse@inside-parse" parse string)
   (dtcall "parse@outside-parse" parse string)))
</PRE></P>

<H2><A HREF="maintainer">Maintainer Access</A></H2>

<P>FramerD servers can provide access to an unrestricted environment
with the <tt>maintainer</tt> procedure.  This procedure takes an
expression and evaluates it in an unrestricted environment; however,
it can only be called by clients on particular remote hosts.  The
procedure <tt>MAINTAINER-OK?</tt>, which must be defined to use the
<tt>maintainer</tt> procedure, validates a maintenance connection, as
in:
 <PRE>
(define (maintainer-ok? client-addr)
  (equal? "admin.framerd.org" client-addr))
</PRE></P>
<P>This definition only lets connections from the host
<tt>admin.framerd.org</tt> use <tt>maintainer</tt>.  Note that this
particular method is subject to IP spoofing attacks.  A better
approach would be to require that forms to be evaluated in an
unrestricted environment be cryptographically signed (volunteers?).</P>

<H2><a name=complicated>A more complicated <tt>fdserver</tt></a></H2>

<P>A more complicated server control file can combines pool/index access
together with special functions related to the data it is providing.  For
example, the following file provides read-only access to a pool and index
recording user comments but also provides an external function for creating a
new comment:
<pre>
(define comments-pool (use-pool (get-component "comments.pool")))
(define comments-index (use-index (get-component "comments.index")))

(serve-pool comments-pool)
(serve-pool comments-index)

;; External clients can't write the pool or index
(set-read-only!)

(define (record-comment user text (time #f))
  (let* ((tstamp (or time (timestamp)))
	 (frame (frame-create comments-pool
                  'user user 'comment text 'time tstamp)))
    (index-frame comments-index frame 'user)
    ;; This will allow free text search on the comment
    (index-frame comments-index frame
                'comment (stem-english-word (elts (segment text))))
    ;; This will allow more clever searching on the user name too
    (index-frame comments-index frame 'user (elts (segment user)))
    ;; And the same for the timestamp; e.g. get-timekeys might
    ;;  return something like: {JAN 2001 D5 WINTER 3AM MORNING}
    (index-frame comments-index frame 'time
                 (get-timekeys (get frame 'time)))
    frame))

(module-export! 'record-comment)
</pre>

<P>In this example, external clients cannot write directly to the
database, but they can search and examine it.  They can also add to it
in a particular, rigorous way defined by the procedure
<tt>record-comment</tt>.  This method ensures that the frame created
is timestamped and indexed in a useful and consistent way.</P>

<H2><A HREF="admin">Administering Servers</A></H2>

<P>The FramerD executable <tt>fdmanager</tt> provides a way of easily
managing multiple servers.  Based on a <em>master control file</em>,
<tt>fdmanager</tt> starts a set of FramerD servers, arranges for their
standard and error output to go to specific log files, and will
restart them if they terminate.  The master control file has multiple
lines of the form: <PRE> [wait=<em>secs</em>] [dependent]
&lt;<em>server control file</em>&gt; <em>fdserver args</em>...  </PRE>
The parameter <tt>wait</tt> specifies how long <tt>fdmanager</tt>
should wait for the server to start before moving onto the next server
in the file.  The flag <tt>dependent</tt> indicates that this server
is dependent on the preceding server and should be restarted if the
preceding server is restarted.  The <em>server control file</em> is an
<tt>.fdz</tt> file passed to <tt>fdserver</tt> and the <em>fdserver
args</em> are passed along with it.  Additional information about
<tt>fdmanager</tt> can be found on its man page.</P>

<P>FramerD comes with an <tt>fdservers</tt> init file designed to work
with the SYSV init scheme common on many Unix systems.  This file is a
shell script which tags the commands <tt>start</tt>, <tt>stop</tt>,
<tt>restart</tt>, and <tt>status</tt>.  It works by starting an
<tt>fdmanager</tt> process using the file <tt><em>framerd
dir</em>/servers</tt> as the control file
(e.g. <tt>/usr/local/share/framerd/servers</tt>).</P>

<P>When started from the <tt>fdservers</tt> init script or some other
system-wide startup mechanism (for instance, <tt>/etc/rc.local</tt>),
servers begin by running as root.  However, as mentioned above, they
almost immediately change their user and group ids to either
<tt>nobody</tt> or <tt>nogroup</tt> or the values of the environment
variables <tt>FDSERVER_USER</tt> and <tt>FDSERVER_GROUP</tt> if they
are valid user and group names.  Since the server running under these
names will need to access the directory of the <tt>.fdz</tt> file (to
write status files such as <tt>.pid</tt> and <tt>.nid</tt> as well as
reading the data files there), it is usually best to have the groups
on the files in this directory set to the FDSERVER_GROUP and to have
appropriate group access permissions set.</P>

<P>The <tt>fdservers</tt> init script sets above the environment
variables to the user and group name <tt>fdaemon</tt>.  Creating this
user and group (or changing the init script) is probably a good idea
for non-experimental installations.</P>

<H2><a name=hairy>Invoking <tt>fdserver</tt></a></H2>

<P>Like most of the FramerD shell commands, fdserver can be paased
configuration variables of the form <tt>VAR=VAL</tt> or <tt>VAR=+VAL</tt> on the command line.
Additional options for invoking fdserver are listed when fdserver is passed
the <tt>--help</tt> option:
<pre>
Usage: fdserver [options*] (<service_name> | <port_id> | <server_init_file>) 

 where options may define configuration variables, e.g.
    FRAMERD_USER=hal9k
 or may be direct options for fdserver:
    --local                Run the server locally (e.g. as localhost)
    --log <filename>       Log connections and statistics to <filename>
                           (use '-' for stdout, '--' for stderr)
    --trace <filename>     Log transaction details to <filename>
                           (use '-' for stdout, '--' for stderr)
    --access (read-only | locking | run-with-scissors)
                           Limit OID and association access according
                           to ruleset specified
    -c | --config <filename>    Load symbol definitions from <filename>
    -m | --module <moduleid>    has the server use the module <moduleid>
    -f | --file <fdscript_file>
                           Load <fdscript_file> before starting
    -e | --eval '<fdscript_code>'
                           Evaluate <fdscript_code> before starting
</pre>
<P>The arguments to the <tt>--access</tt> option have the following meaning:
<dl>
<dt>read-only</dt><dd>the served pools or indices cannot be remotely modified at all</dd>
<dt>locking</dt><dd>oid-level locking is provided for served pools</dd>
<dt>sloppy</dt><dd>OIDs can be written but no locking is provided</dd>
</dl>
<P>The value of this option will have no effect if the server itself cannot
modify one of its pools or indices; in such a case, the pool or index is
read-only no matter what access is specified.</P>

<P>For debugging purposes, two useful arguments to fdserver are
<tt>--log</tt> and <tt>--trace</tt>.  These activiate logging and
tracing (respectively) and send the results to a specified file.  If a
dash (-) is specified as the file, results go to the standard output;
if two dashes (--) are specified, results go to the standard error.
<strong>Logging</strong> reports each connections and disconnections
of clients with the server.  <strong>Tracing</strong> reports each
request and the value returned.</P>

<P>One can specify that a server only runs locally by passing the
command line arguments <tt>--local yes</tt> to <tt>fdserver</tt>.  You
can then access this server through server ids of the form
"port@localhost".  This is useful if you are using FramerD on a
machine which is only intermittenly connected to the network.</P>

<P>Each of these options can also be specified in the server control file, by
the following functions:
<dl>
<dt>set-read-only!</dt><dd>sets the server to be externally read-only</dd>
<dt>set-sloppy!</dt><dd>sets the server to be externally writable,
without locking</dd>
<dt>set-log!</dt><dd>takes two stream arguments: one for connection logging,
one for comprehensive transaction logging</dd>
</dl>
