<P>At its creation in the early 1990's, the World Wide Web was
imagined as `just' a medium for global publication and conversation.
It subsequently grew into (among other things) a framework for
application deployment where the ubiquitous web browser provided a GUI
for networked applications.  FramerD and FDScript have been especially
extended to take advantage of this environment in two different
ways.</P>

<P>First, FDScript provides numerous special forms and operations for
generating HTML --- the language interpreted by web browsers --- and
XML, HTML's younger, more refined, and more versatile cousin.  These
mechanisms rely on an analogy between the recursive, nested structures
of HTML/XML and the similar structure of Lisp (FDScript) expressions.
This (in our unbiased opinion) makes it much easier to write programs
which produce correct HTML (or XML) markup.  The framework for
generating HTML also contains special provisions for presenting
FramerD frames as links to <em>browse scripts</em> which can present
the frame to the user as an HTML document.</P>

<P>Second, FDScript programs are able to use the <A
HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI protocol</A> to gain
access to particular information provided by clients to web servers.
The CGI (for Common Gateway Interface) protocol was designed to allow
browsers to pass along user information, especially the results of
filling out online forms.  FramerD scripts running on a web server can
read the values which users put in forms and customize action and
presentation based on these specifications.</P>

<P>Together, these two features make for a complete application
framework, where FramerD applications can be written which are usable
by any individual with a web browser.  This document describes how to
build such applications, starting with how FDScript can generate HTML,
moving on to how it can access CGI parameters, and wrapping up with a
discussion of how to get all of this working together under the <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache web server</A>.</P>

<H2><a name=generating>Generating Markup</a></H2>

<P>Web documents are typically encoded and transmitted in a <em>markup
language</em> where content is interspersed with machine-recognizable
tags indicating document structure or presentation information.
FDScript provides ways to automatically generate documents with markup
information for two pervasive markup standards: XML and HTML.  XML is
an extensible standard for document markup; HTML is a more limited
standard for mostly "display markup" which is a cornerstone of
documents published on the World Wide Web.  These standards are
closely related and --- except for a few handfuls of exceptions ---
HTML can be interpreted as a kind of XML.</P>

<P>The FDScript modules <tt class=symbol>XMLGEN</tt> and <tt
class=symbol>HTMLGEN</tt> provide functions for generating markup
based on the <A HREF="fdscript-guide.html#printout">PRINTOUT</A> model
for producing formatted output.  The PRINTOUT model uses Scheme
expressions to generate complex documents.  Expressions are evaluated
depth-first from left to right, producing output; expressions which
evaluate to strings are displayed verbatim; expressions evaluating to
other (non-void) values are displayed with <tt
class=symbol>WRITE</tt>; and expressions which don't return values or
return the void value are ignored (and are assumed to have done their
own output).  This allows new formatting directives to be implemented
simply as functions which do output and return void values.</P>

<P>The most general primitive for generating marked up content is
<tt class=symbol>MARKUP</tt>:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(markup 'P "Two plus three is " (markup 'strong (+ 2 3)))
</pre>
<p>which outputs the text:</p>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;P&gt;Two plus three is &lt;STRONG&gt;5&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt
</pre>
<p>which renders as something like this in a browser:</p>
<blockquote>
Two plus three is <strong>5</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>The generation of marked up text manages character encoding
automatically, so that Unicode strings or symbols are rendered with
approriate escapes in marked up documents.</p>

<P>The <tt class=symbol>MARKUP</tt> function always produces markup with some
"content" and with matching start and end tags (e.g. "&lt;P&gt;" and
"&lt;/P&gt;").  To produce so-called "empty tags," the functions <tt
class=symbol>HTMLTAG</tt> and <tt class=symbol>XMLTAG</tt> can be used.  They
each take as arguments a sequence of "markup attributes" which are included in
the output.  For example:
<pre class=typescript>
(HTMLTAG 'IMG 'SRC "foo.png" 'ALT "This is a picture of a foo")
</pre>
<p>produces the following output:</p>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;IMG SRC="foo.png" ALT="This is a picture of a foo"&gt;
</pre>
<p>The same call to <tt class=symbol>XMLTAG</tt> produces almost exactly the
same text but replaces the terminating `&gt;' with `/&gt;' to obey the XML
specification for empty elements.</p>

<H3><a name=attributes>Generating markup attributes</a></H3>

<P>Tags in both HTML and XML can have associated attributes which
provide important additional parameters.  Attributes can be specified for 
<tt>MARKUP</tt> by giving a list as an argument, rather than a symbol:
<pre class=typescript>
(markup '(P ALIGN RIGHT) "This paragraph should be flush right")
</pre>
<p>where the first element of the list is the markup tag used and the remaining
elements are taken as alternating attribute names and values, so that
we get this marked up output:</p>
<pre class=typescript>
&lt;P ALIGN=RIGHT&gt;This paragraph should be flush right&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>
<p>which would be rendered thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>This paragraph should be flush right
</blockquote>
<P>By using backquote, the results of evaluation can be included in
the attributes of generated markup, as in:
<pre class="typescript">
(markup `(FONT SIZE ,(+ 7 (get-importance)))
        "This paragraph should be flush right")
</pre>

<H3><a name=builtins>HTML builtins</a></H3>

<P>In addition to these general ways of generating markup, the <tt>HTMLGEN</tt>
module contains a plethora of specialized expressions for generating
HTML-specific tags.  The general form of these functions takes the name of the
HTML markup tag as a procedure name, so that:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(H2 "This is a level " 2 " heading")
</pre>
<P>yields the marked up text:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
&lt;H2&gt;This is a level 2 heading&lt;/H2&gt;
</pre>
<P>Attributes can be specified by using an expression where the
function name has an asterisk (*) suffix:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(OL* (STYLE "a")
  (LI "First letter")
  (LI "Second letter")
  (LI "Third letter"))
</pre>
<P>interpeting the first argument as a list of alternating attributes
and values, yielding the markup:</P>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;OL STYLE="a"&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;First letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Second letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Third letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/OL&gt;
</pre>

<P>These naming conventions are changed when a given tag doesn't "make
sense" without any attributes.  In these cases, the unmodified form of
the tag name is defined as a function which takes markup attributes,
e.g. as with the anchor tag <tt class=symbol>A</tt>:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(A (HREF "http://www.framerd.org/") "Visit the FramerD web site")
</pre>
<P>which yields the markup:</P>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;A HREF="http://www.framerd.org/"&gt;Visit the FramerD web site&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
<P>or the <tt class=symbol>FONT</tt> tag,</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(P "This word should be almost " 
   (FONT (COLOR "purple") "violet"))
</pre>

<P>These HTML tags have corresponding generators in
<tt class=symbol>HTMLGEN</tt>:</P>
<blockquote>
<tt class=symbol>H1</tt>, <tt class=symbol>H2</tt>, <tt class=symbol>H3</tt>, <tt class=symbol>H4</tt>, <tt class=symbol>CENTER</tt>,
<tt class=symbol>P</tt>, <tt class=symbol>BLOCKQUOTE</tt>, <tt class=symbol>OL</tt>, <tt class=symbol>UL</tt>,
<tt class=symbol>LI</tt>, <tt class=symbol>TABLE</tt>, <tt class=symbol>TR</tt>, <tt class=symbol>TH</tt>, <tt class=symbol>TD</tt>,
<tt class=symbol>EM</tt>, <tt class=symbol>STRONG</tt>, <tt class=symbol>DEFN</tt>, <tt class=symbol>TT</tt>,
<tt class=symbol>SUB</tt>, <tt class=symbol>SUP</tt>, <tt class=symbol>FONT</tt>, <tt class=symbol>SPAN</tt>,
<tt class=symbol>DIV</tt>.
</blockquote>
<P>The last three generators always take an attribute argument, as described above.  All of the functions,
including the last three, have <TT><var>tag</var>*</TT> variants which take arguments.

<P>The following functions generate the corresponding `empty' tags:</P>
<blockquote>
<tt class=symbol>HR</tt>, <tt class=symbol>BR</tt>, <tt class=symbol>IMG</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>interpreting their arguments as paramaters directly, e.g.</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(IMG SRC "image1.png" ALT (string-append "Imagine seeing " "image.png"))
</pre>
<P>would yield the markup text:</P>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;IMG SRC="image1.png" ALT="Imagine seeing image.png"&gt;
</pre>

<H2><a name=linking>Generating Links</a></H2>

<P>Possibly the most defining feature of the World Wide Web is the
capacity for <em>hyperlinking</em> between documents, letting a
fragment of text in one document lead directly to another document (or
a fragment therein).  By selecting the link in one document, a reader
can have instant access to another document or fragment.  In HTML,
this linking is accomplished with the <tt>A</tt> element; a document
generator can use a <tt class=symbol>MARKUP</tt> expression to
generate a link in this way:</P>
<pre>
(markup '(A HREF "http://www.whitehouse.gov/")
        "Where President " current-president " lives.")
</pre>

<P>The <tt class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> function is a special markup
function intended to simplify certain patterns of hyperlinking.  Its
first argument is a <em>destination</em> which may interpreted in
various ways:</P>
<ul>
<li>a <em>string</em> is simply used as a regular URL reference</li>
<li>a <em>symbol</em> is taken as an internal reference to the
current document (in HTML, this becomes a "#name" link)</li>
<li>a <em>list</em> must be a pair of a string and a symbol,
indicating a document and an internal pointer in that document</li>
</ul>
<P>For example, the following are possible <tt
class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> expressions:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(anchor "http://www.framerd.org/" "This is the FramerD web site")
(anchor '("http://www.framerd.org/docs/www-guide.html" ANCHOR)
        "This points to the description of the " 'ANCHOR " expression")
(anchor 'INTRO
        "This points to the section of the current document which is tagged as INTRO")
</pre>

<P>Passing a symbol to <tt class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> usually implies a call to
the <A HREF="tagged"><tt class=symbol>TAGGED</tt></A> expression elsewhere in
the document.  The <tt class=symbol>TAGGED</tt> expression marks its content
with a named tag which <tt class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> can refer to.  For
example,</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(tagged 'intro "This is the introduction as generated on " (datestring))
</pre>

<P>The first argument to <tt class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> is evaluated, so
it can be another expression whose value is the actual destination.
For example, this definition produces an email address link for a
particular individual.</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(define (email-addr real-name email)
  (ANCHOR (string-append "mailto:" email)
          "Send electronic mail to " real-name))
</pre>
<P>and could easily be included in another document thus</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(email-addr "Ken Haase" "haase@media.mit.edu")
</pre>
<P>which would generate the markup:</P>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;A HREF="mailto:haase@media.mit.edu"&gt;Send electronic mail to Ken Haase&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<H3><A NAME="scripturl">Generating Complex Anchors</A></H3>

<P>The destination of an HTML anchor does not have to be a static
document existing on some remote machine.  Commonly, it can refer to a
virtual document generated by a program on some remote computer based
on some inputs.  The <tt class=symbol>HTMLGEN</tt> library provides a
special function for generating such references: <tt
class=symbol>SCRIPTURL</tt>, whose first argument is a remote URL to
be invoked as a script.  <tt>SCRIPTURL</tt> has two forms.  The first
takes one additional argument, which is a query string to pass to the
script, e.g.</P>
<pre class=typescript>
[fdscript] (index-url "http://www.altavista.com/search.cgi" "Scheme Hackers")
"http://www.altavista.com/search.cgi?Scheme+Hackers"
</pre>
<P>automatically encoding the string into characters valid for a URL.</P>

<P>The second form of <tt class=symbol>SCRIPTURL</tt> is intended for
use with scripts which expect a number of named inputs (rather than a
single query string).  These are typically scripts intended to process
the input from HTML forms.  As before, the first argument in this form
is a string indicating the script's URL; the remaining arguments are
alternating symbols (indicating named inputs) and values (indicating
values assigned to them).  For example:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(ANCHOR (SCRIPTURL "http://www.beingmeta.com/brico/search.fdcgi"
                    LANGUAGE "NL" WORDS "hoofd")
        "This looks up the Dutch word " "`hoofd'"
	" in the BRICO knowledge base")
</pre>
<P>generates an anchor which will list a set of frames from the BRICO
knowledge base, dynamically generated by the <tt
class=symbol>enter.fdcgi</tt> script.</P>

<H2><a name=cgi>Dynamic Pages from FDScript</a></H2>

<P>We just saw how to make links which point to virtual pages
generated by remote scripts.  The protocol for generating such remote
pages is the <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">CGI
protocol</A> which is standard on nearly all web servers. This section
describes how to write such scripts using FDScript.  In general, a
script for generating a virtual page is an FDScript file placed on a
web server, marked as executable, and starting with a line indicating
where the <tt class=symbol>fdcgi</tt> executable can be found,
e.g. something like:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
</pre>

<P>For example when your web server is properly <A
HREF="#configure">configured</A>, you should be able to create a
script file <tt class=symbol>test.fdcgi</tt>:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;; This is the file test.fdcgi
(define (main)
  (httpdoc
    (title "This is demonstration FDCGI script")
    (H1 "This is a heading")
    (P "This is the file " arg0 " being run at "
       (iso-timestring (xtimestamp)))))
</pre>
<P>and set it to be executable.  You should then be able to access the
URL <tt class=symbol>http://<var>your host</var>/<var>some
path</var>/test.fdcgi</tt> where <var>some path</var> is dependent on
how the web server is configured to map URLs into local filenames.
Accessing this URL will produce a page dynamically generated by the
<tt class=symbol>main</tt> procedure defined above.  When you access
the page again (or reload it from your browser), it will appear with a
different date, since it is regenerated for each access.</P>

<P>Normally, the web server will start a new <tt
class=symbol>fdcgi</tt> script for each page access; however, if your
server is configured to support FastCGI for FramerD scripts, <tt
class=symbol>fdcgi</tt> will only be run once for each separate
script, processing multiple requests within the same process.  This
can provide much faster response and less use of system resources for
starting the script over and over again.</P>

<H2><a name=cgivars>Script Variables</a></H2>

<P>Scripts generating dynamic pages can typically use input variables
from a variety of sources:</P>
<ul>

<li><strong>server variables</strong> are defined by the web server
and include (for instance), the network address of the browser making
the request</li>

<li><strong>client variables</strong> are defined by the browser
making the request; these can include identity information or
<em>cookies</em> maintaining client-side state</li>

<li><strong>script variables</strong> are defined by the script itself
or the interpreter running the script; these include all of the
standard <tt class=symbol>fdscript</tt> functions as well as the
contents of the text, xmlgen, and htmlgen modules</li>

<li><strong>request variables</strong> are defined for a particular
script and generally come from the client-side "form" by which the
script has been invoked</li>

</ul>
<P>These variables are all gathered together into a single slotmap bound to <tt
class=symbol>CGI-DATA</tt> when the script's main procedure is executed.
We could use this, for instance, to modify <tt class=symbol>test.fdcgi</tt>
above to report the clients address:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;; This is the file test.fdcgi
(define (main)
  (httpdoc
    (title "This is demonstration FDCGI script")
    (H1 "This is a heading")
    (P "This is the file " arg0 " being run at "
       (iso-timestring (xtimestamp)))
    (P "You are connecting from the Internet address " 
       (get cgi-data 'remote-host))))
</pre>
<P>The following server and client variables are typically available
to CGI scripts.</P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Variable</TH><TH>Meaning</TH></TR>

<TR><TD>USER-AGENT</TD><TD>A string identifying the client program
(browser) being used; e.g. </TD></TR>

<TR><TD>REFERER</TD><TD>The URL from which the user clicked to this URL.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>REMOTE-HOST</TD><TD>The hostname of the machine making the
request; this is either the client's machine or the `proxy server'
they are operating through.  Depending on the configuration of the
webserver, this value may be either a "real" host name (like
<tt class=symbol>flipper.media.mit.edu</tt>) or a simple IP address (like
<tt class=symbol>18.85.2.138</tt>).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>REMOTE-ADDRESS</TD><TD>The IP address of the machine making the
request; again, this is either the client's machine or the `proxy server'
they are operating through.  This is always a simple IP address (like
<tt class=symbol>18.85.2.138</tt>).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>REMOTE-IDENT</TD><TD>If provided, this is a string identifying
the remote user.  If the client did not provide this information, it
is not bound.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SCRIPT-NAME</TD><TD>The filename of the script being
executed.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SERVER-NAME</TD><TD>The name of the machine on which this
server is being run.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SERVER-PORT</TD><TD>The name of the port on which this
server is listening.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SERVER-SOFTWARE</TD><TD>A string identifying
the software and version of the Web server which is invoking
this script.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>SERVER-HOST-NAME</TD><TD>The server name explicitly requested
by the client.  This is for use with virtual servers, where different
requests to the same machine may go to different virtual servers.
This variable contains the name of the virtual server for the request.
(It corresponds to the HTTP/1.1 <tt>hostname:</tt> request
field.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>PATH-INFO</TD><TD>Additional information given in the path of
the URL.  For more information, see the <A
HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/interface.html">CGI
spec</A>.</TR>


<TR><TD>DOCUMENT-ROOT</TD><TD>The file system location where
the document tree for the webserver lives.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>PATH-TRANSLATED</TD><TD>The translated pathname,
in the local file system, for the current document (the script
being run).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>AUTH-TYPE</TD><TD>If an authorization method was used to
validate the user's identity, this is the method which was used.</TR>

<TR><TD>REMOTE-USER</TD><TD>If an authorization method was used to
validate the user's identity, this is the identification used.</TR>

<TR><TD>HTTP-COOKIE</TD><TD>The HTTP cookie argument passed with the
request.  This cookie is also split apart into individual variable bindings
for each of the named cookies.  E.G. if the client passes a cookie
named <TT>COLOR</TT> the cgi variable <TT>color</TT> will be set.</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>A good text on CGI scripting will describe these variables (which are
conventions in the CGI protocol) in more detail.  The only substantial
difference is that those texts and their programs may use underscores (_)
rather than dashes (-) in variable names.</P>

<H2><a name=cgiforms>Using Forms</a></H2>

<P>To see how this works with interpreting the input from an HTML form,
consider the following HTML fragment:</P>
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;H1&gt;A silly form&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;form action="silly-form.fdcgi"&gt;
My name is &lt;input type='text' name='informant'&gt;.  My favorite color is
&lt;select name='color'&gt;
&lt;option&gt;Red
&lt;option&gt;Green
&lt;option&gt;Blue
&lt;option&gt;Black
&lt;option&gt;White
&lt;/select&gt;

&lt;P&gt;However, I think that `white'
&lt;input type=radio name='white' value=yes&gt;&nbsp;is
&lt;input type=radio name='white' value=no&gt;&nbsp;is&nbsp;not
a color</P>
&lt;P&gt;&lt;input type=checkbox name='black' value=yes&gt;&nbsp;I think that `black'
is a color
&lt;/form&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>

<P>The results of this form could be processed by a file <tt
class=symbol>silly-form.fdcgi</tt>:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;;; This is the file silly-form.fdcgi
(define (main)
  (httpdoc (title "Answers to silly form")
    (H1 "Hello, " (get cgi-data 'informant))
    (let ((col (get cgi-data 'color))
          (is-white-a-color? (equal? (get cgi-data 'white) "yes")))
      (P "So, your favorite color is " (font (color col) col)
         " and you think that white "
         (if is-white-a-color? "is" "is not")
         " a color")
    (if (exists? (get cgi-data 'black))
        (P "And you have an opinion about whether black is a color too"))))
</pre>
<P>For more information about writing forms in HTML, consult a
document such as <A
HREF="http://www.cc.ukans.edu/~acs/docs/other/forms-intro.shtml">this
summary</A>.</P>

<P>The <tt class=symbol>HTMLGEN</tt> module also includes primitives for
generating forms.  For example, a form like that above could be generated
by:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
(define colors '("red" "green" "blue" "black" "white"))
(define (main)
  (httpdoc (title "A silly form")
    (H1 "A silly form")
    (FORM (ACTION "silly-form.fdcgi")
      (P "My name is " (textfield 'informant) ".  "
         "My favorite color is "
         (selection (dolist (clr colors)) (option 'color clr) clr) ".")
      (P "I think that white "
         (radiobutton 'white "yes") "&nbsp;is"
         (radiobutton 'white "no") "&nbsp;is&nbsp;not"
         " a color")
      (P (checkbox 'black "yes") "I think that black is a color."))))
</pre>

<H2><a name=cgivar><tt>CGI-VAR</tt> and <tt>CGI-INIT</tt></a></H2>

<P>It is often more convenient way to access CGI parameters with the special
forms <tt class="symbol">CGI-INIT</tt> and <tt class="symbol">CGI-VAR</tt>.
These forms create local bindings (just like Scheme's internal <tt
class="symbol">DEFINE</tt>s) into which the parameter values are stored.  For
example, we could reimplement <tt>silly-form.fdcgi</tt> using <tt
class="symbol">CGI-INIT</tt>:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;;; This is the file silly-form.fdcgi
(define (main)
  ;; This locally binds these variables to the string passed as part of
  ;; the current CGI request
  (cgi-init informant color white black)
  (httpdoc (title "Answers to silly form")
    (H1 "Hello, " informant)
    (P "So, your favorite color is " (font (color col) col)
       " and you think that white "
       (if (equal? white "Yes") "is" "is not") " a color")
    (if (not (null? black))
        (P "And you have an opinion about whether black is a color too"))))
</pre>
<P>The difference between <tt class="symbol">CGI-INIT</tt> and <tt
class="symbol">CGI-VAR</tt> is how much the process their arguments.
<tt class="symbol">CGI-INIT</tt> leaves all of its arguments as strings
and uses a list of strings when the client provides multiple values
for a variable.  <tt>CGI-VAR</tt>, on the other hand, calls a special version
of the FDScript's LISP parser on the string it gets from the client; it also
collects multiple values into an unordered choice rather than a list.
To see how this works, consider the following simple "calculator" form:
<PRE class=markup>
&lt;H1&gt;Adding Numbers&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;form action="calculate.fdcgi"&gt;
What is &lt;input type='text' name='num1'&gt;&nbsp;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='op' value='+'&gt;&nbsp;+&nbsp;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='op' value='+'&gt;&nbsp;-&nbsp;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='op' value='+'&gt;&nbsp;*&nbsp;
&lt;input type='checkbox' name='op' value='+'&gt;&nbsp;/&nbsp;
&lt;input type='text' name='num2'&gt;
&lt;input type='submit' value='?'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<P>This could be processed by the following <tt>.fdcgi</tt> file:
<pre>
(define (main)
  (cgi-var num1 num2 op)
  (httpdoc (title "Combining two numbers")
    ;; Always show the sum
    (P num1 "+" num2 "=" (+ num1 num2))
    (do-choices (each op)
      (P num1 op num2 "=" ((eval op) num1 num2)))))
</pre>
<P>Using <tt class=symbol>CGI-INIT</tt> instead of <tt
class=symbol>CGI-VAR</tt> would have bound <tt
class=symbol>num1</tt> and <tt
class=symbol>num2</tt> to strings, and <tt>op</tt> to a list of strings;
this would have signalled an error when <tt
class=symbol>+</tt> was called to add them; had it had the chance, it also
would have signalled an error when it attempted to evaluate the list of
strings to get an operator.</P>

<H2><a name=cookies>Cookies</a></H2>

<P>The HTTP 1.1 protocol provides a way to maintain client-side state using
<em>cookies</em>.  A cookie is a string, stored with the client's browser,
which is sent along with requests to identify the browser and client.  Cookies
may be set automatically (though sometimes, browsers ask the user to confirm
the acceptance of a cookie) when certain documents are read and then sent along
automatically with subsequent requests.</P>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(SET-COOKIE! <var>symbol</var>
<var>value</var> [<var>domain+path</var>] [<var>expires</var>])</tt>
includes a cookie with the current page being generated.  If the page
is read on a browser, subsequent requests from the browser will bind
the CGI variable <var>symbol</var> to <var>value</var>.  The
additional arguments limit the scope of the cookie so that it is only
sent back to a particular path or to particular domains or up till a
specified time.  The argument <var>domain+path</var> can have the form
of a qualified domain name (in which case all hosts in the specified
domain will receive the cookie), a slash-separated pathname (in which
case scripts beneath that path on the current server will receive the
cookie), or both together (in which case scripts beneath the path on
any hosts in the domain will receive the cookie).</P>

<P>If the value <var>value</var> is a string, it is used directly
(with escapes in and out of Unicode handled automatically); otherwise,
it is converted to a string and set as a string when subsequently
received.  The function <TT>parse-arg</TT> can be used to convert it
back to a Lisp object.</P>

<H2><a name=browsing>Frames to Anchors</a></H2>

<P>As we described above, one of the greatest things about the World
Wide Web is the ability to link between documents.  Comparably, one of
the greatest things about FramerD and FDScript is the easy ability for
objects (frames) to refer to other frames.  These two aspects are
connected whenever HTML generation needs to display a frame reference
(an OID) on a web page.  The frame reference is "made live" by
converting it into an <em>anchor</em> which refers to a <strong>browse
script</strong> directed at the OID.  The browse script is just an
FDCGI script (actually it could be any kind of script, but practically
it is nearly always an FDCGI script) which interprets its argument as
a frame reference and describes the corresponding frame.  When
everything comes together, a user can just click on a frame
description and --- voila! --- get a description of the frame.</P>

<P>The default browse script used in generating such "live links" is
called <tt class=file>browse.fdcgi</tt>, which browsers normally
interpret with respect to the path of the URL under which the
reference appears.  This means that if a script in one directory
displays a reference to a frame, it will refer to the script <tt
class=file>browse.fdcgi</tt> in the current directory.</P>

<P>The procedure <tt class="symbol">USE-BROWSE-SCRIPT!</tt> sets the
default browse script or to set a special browse script for a
particular OID or a particular pool.  Different browse scripts may be
customized to different applications, highlighting different aspects
of the frame or even presenting just the information in the frame
without any indication of its "framishness".  For example, the GNOSYS
knowledge management application uses a browse script which renders
frames describing web pages into a reconstructed version of the web
page, subtly annotated with pointers into GNOSYS' knowledge base.</P>

<P>When provided, the second argument to <TT
class="symbol">USE-BROWSE-SCRIPT!</TT> can be an OID or a pool,
specifying that the first argument (a URL) be used to browse either
the particular OID or all OIDs in the designated pool.</P>

<P>In any case, the basic framework for a browse script is very
simple.  For example, the following browse script simply displays a
table of slot values.</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;; This is the file sbrowse.fdcgi
(use-browse-script! "sbrowse.fdcgi")
(define (main)
  (cgi-var QUERY) ;; Get the query string
  (httpdoc (header 'pragma "no-cache") ; the browser shouldn't save this
    (TITLE "Description of the frame " QUERY)
    (H1 "Description of the frame " QUERY)
    (table
      (doslots (f slot value QUERY)
        (tr (th slot) (td value)))))))

</pre>
<P>This kind of tabular display is also generated by the special HTML
generation procedure <tt>FRAME-&gt;HTML</tt>; the script above could
have been rewritten simply as:</P>
<pre class=typescript>
#!/usr/local/bin/fdcgi
;; This is the file sbrowse.fdcgi
(use-browse-script! "sbrowse.fdcgi")
(define (main)
  (cgi-var QUERY) ;; Get the query string
  (httpdoc (header 'pragma "no-cache") ; the browser shouldn't save this
    (TITLE "Description of the frame " QUERY)
    (H1 "Description of the frame " QUERY)
    (FRAME-&gt;HTML QUERY)))
</pre>
<P>In fact, the display would probably look better than the simple tabular
format produced by the original version since <TT>FRAME-&gt;HTML</TT> takes
advantage of a few HTML bells and whistles).</P>

<P>The default generation of live links from frames can always be
overridden by an explicit <tt class=symbol>ANCHOR</tt> expression
combined with a URL generated by <tt class=symbol>SCRIPTURL</tt>,
e.g.</P>
<pre>
(anchor (scripturl "alternate-browse-script.fdcgi" frame)
        (get frame 'obj-name))
</pre>

<P>Also, while OIDs are normally linked to browse scripts, generated
documents sometimes have descriptions of several OIDs within the
document and it would be better to have clicking on the OID go to
another location in the currently generated document.  When the
argument to a <tt class=symbol>TAGGED</tt> expression [<A
HREF="tagged">ref</A>] is a frame, it creates just such an internal
link target; subsequent presentation of the frame will turn into a
link to the internal pointer rather than external script invocation.
To make things easier still, descriptions of frames generated by <tt
class=symbol>FRAME-&gt;HTML</tt> generates an automatic tag for
internal reference.</P>

<P>The only problem with this is that the description itself (from <tt
class=symbol>TAGGED</tt> or <tt class=symbol>FRAME-&gt;HTML</tt>)
needs to be generated before any references to the OID it describes
(so the reference can know that there is an internal pointer).  To get
around this particular problem, the procedure <tt
class=symbol>(DECLARE-LOCAL-FRAME!  <var>frame</var>)</tt> asserts
that <var>frame</var> will be an internal reference, forcing the
generation of OID anchors to be internal.</P>

<H2><a name=details>Details of HTTP generation</a></H2>

<P>When generating a document, FDScript divides document generation into four
distinct phases:
<ol>
<li>HTTP header generation; this is where cookies are set and URL redirection
can happen</li>
<li>HTML HEAD generation; this is where titles, metadata, and stylesheets
(among other properties) are emitted</li>
<li>HTML BODY generation; this is where what the user sees is generated</li>
<li>HTML post generation; this is normally empty, but is kept to signal
errors when attempts to output content occur after the document is finished
</li>
</ol>

<H3>HTTP Header Phase Procedures</H3>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>HEADER</tt> outputs an HTTP header and signals
an error if it is too late to do so.  One particularly useful application is to
provide a <tt>pragma</tt> header of "no-cache" to keep the browser from caching
the contents of a dynamically changing page.  It would be emitted by this expression:</P>
<pre>
   (header 'pragma "no-cache")
</pre>
<P>The first argument is a symbol or string naming the header to be sent;
the second argument is a string containing the actual content.  Note that
<tt>header</tt> (like the other header phase procedures) must be called before
any HTML primitives (either content generating primitives like <tt>P</tt> or
metadata primitives like <tt>TITLE</tt>) are called.</P>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(HTTP-REDIRECT <var>url</var>)</tt> generates
a header which redirects the browser to <var>url</var>.

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(HTTP-SPLASH <var>url</var>
<var>interval</var>)</tt> emits a <tt class=symbol>Refresh:</tt> header which
will cause the page to reload from <var>url</var> every <var>interval</var>
seconds.

<H3>HTML HEAD Phase Procedures</H3>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(TITLE <var>...args</var>)</tt> adds a
<tt>title</tt> element to the header; this is often displayed at the top
of the browser frame.  The arguments are processed <tt>PRINTOUT</tt>-style:</P>
<pre>
  (title "This document was generated under "
         (get (resources) 'os) " on " (get-day))
</pre>
<p>would produce markup of the form:</p>
<pre>
&lt;TITLE&gt;This document was generated under i686-unknown-linux on SATURDAY&lt;/TITLE&gt;
</pre>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(STYLESHEET! <var>local or global url
reference</var>)</tt> adds a declaration to the header indicating which
stylesheet to use for displaying this document.  For example</P>
<pre>
  (stylesheet! "fdsite.css")
</pre>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(META <var>var</var> <var>val</var>)</tt>
specifies a META HTML header (such as KEYWORDS or author).  For example:</P>
<pre>
  (META 'keywords "knowledge,poetry,natural language")
</pre>

<P>The function <tt class=symbol>(SET-DOCTYPE! <var>type</var>
<var>location</var>)</tt> configures the <tt class=symbol>!DOCTYPE</tt> header
used in a generated document.  The <var>type</var> argument should be a symbol
while the <var>location</var> argument should be either a URL or a standard
reference to be recognized by the browser (starting with "+" or "-").</P>

<H2><a name=configure>Configuring your Web Server</a></H2>

<P><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>This section is a provisional
guide to setting up an Apache web server to use fdcgi scripts.  It
explains what I've done for my web servers, but it may not be the best
way to do things.  I'm not an expert Apache hacker.</em></P>

<P>To set up your web server to run <tt>fdcgi</tt> scripts in a
particular directory, you need to tell Apache two things:</P>
<ol>
<li>it's okay to execute scripts in the directory where your <tt>.fdcgi</tt>
files live</li>

<li>files ending in <tt>.fdcgi</tt> should be handled as CGI
scripts</li>
</ol>

<P>To do the first, add the following to your web server's
<tt>httpd.conf</tt> configuration file:</P>
<pre class=markup>
&lt;Location /<var>dir</var>&gt;
Options ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .fdcgi
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
<P>where <var>dir</var> is the directory where your files live.</P>

<P>If you want to be able to have <tt>.fdcgi</tt> scripts anywhere,
you can add the following to the <tt>access.conf</tt> file:</P>
<pre class=markup>
&lt;Location /&gt;
Options ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .fdcgi
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

<H3><a name=fdserv>Using mod_fdserv</a></H3>

<P>FramerD can be used, with the Apache <strong>mod_fdserv</strong>
module, to implement persistent multi-threaded web applications.  This
module can be installed through either a bundled RPM or DEB package or
by typing <tt>make fdserv-install</tt> in the root of the FramerD
build tree. It can also be downloaded directly in <A
HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/framerd/mod_fdserv.c?download">source
form</A> and compiled and installed with <TT>apxs>.</P>

<P>Once installed, the module can then be configured by editing your
site's <tt class="file">httpd.conf</tt> to include a line something
like:
<pre>
    AddHandler fdservlet .fdcgi .fdxml
</pre>
</P>

<P>The apache module works by establishing a persistent server using
the Framerd <tt>fdservlet</tt> executable and communicating to that
server through local sockets (it doesn't currently work under
WIN32).  But normally, such implementation details shouldn't matter.</P>

<P>Once set up as above, <tt>mod_fdserv</tt> can be further configured
with the following commands:
<DL>
<DT>FDServletExecutable <var>filename</var></DT>
<DD>specifies the path to the <tt>fdservlet</tt>
executable.  If unspecified, it assumes
<tt class="filename">/usr/bin/fdservlet</tt>.
Note that this can only be configured on a per server/per virtual host
basis.</DD>

<DT>FDServletThreads <var>n</var></DT>
<DD>Indicates the number of threads the underlying server should start
for responding to requests.  The default is five threads.</DD>

<DT>FDServletPrefix <var>pathname_prefix</var></DT> <DD>Indicates the
prefix to any sockets created by <strong>mod_fdserv</strong> and
passed to <tt>fdservlet</tt>.  It defaults to <tt
class="filename">/tmp/fdserv</tt>.

<DT>FDServletLogFile <var>filename</var></DT>
<DD>Specifies the file to which servlet's stdout and stderr will be
redirected.</DD>

<DT>FDServletSocketFile <var>pathname</var></DT>
<DD>Indicates the particular pathname to be used for the
socket for a particular document or script.  This does
not make sense to specify for a particular directory.</DD>
</DL></P>

<P>The combination of <tt>mod_fdserv</tt> and <tt>fdservlet</tt>
handle both scripted files (e.g. <tt>.fdcgi</tt> files) and dynamic
document files (e.g. <tt>.fdxml</tt> or <tt>.fdhtml</tt> files).</P>

<H3><a name=fastcgi>Using FastCGI</a></H3>

<P>FramerD also has support for the <A
HREF="http://www.FastCGI.com/">FastCGI</A> protocol (also, check out
<A HREF="http://www.fastcgi.org/">here</A>).  If you have the Apache
module <A
HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/mod_fastcgi-2.2.12.tar.gz"><tt>mod_fastcgi</tt></A>
installed, it should be possible to say:
<PRE>
AddHandler fastcgi-script .fdcgi
</PRE>
<P>to have .fdcgi scripts handled by fast-cgi.  However, in order for
the FramerD <tt>fdcgi</tt> executable to talk with this module, it
needs to be compiled with fastcgi support.  You can do this by
installing OpenMarket's <A
HREF="http://www.fastcgi.com/dist/fcgi-2.2.2.tar.gz">FastCGI
development kit</A> and reconfiguring and recompiling FramerD.
FramerD's configuration script should find the installed development
kit and link against it.</P>

<P>Finally, there is a modified version of the <tt>mod_fastcgi</tt> module
especially for use with FramerD.  Called <tt>mod_fdcgi</tt>, it invokes either
the <tt>fdcgi</tt> or <tt>fdxml</tt> interpreters, depending on the script's
suffix.  You still need to declare the handler with:</P>
<pre>
Options ExecCGI
AddHandler fdcgi .fdcgi
AddHandler fdcgi .fdxml
</pre>
<P>in the appropriate location in <tt>httpd.conf</tt>, but you do not need to
declare the script executable or have the <tt>#!/usr/local/bin/fd...</tt> in
the file's first line.  As with cgi and fastcgi, the scripts are run as
neutered users (typically <tt>nobody</tt>) in order to enhance security.  We
use <tt>mod_fdcgi</tt> on our sites and it works fine.  You can 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.framerd.org/downloads/mod_fdcgi.tar.gz">download</A>
it from framerd.org or find it elsewhere on the web.</P>
