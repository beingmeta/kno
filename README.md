# This is FramerD

**FramerD** is a production-ready platform and database for
applications and services which leverage knowledge and context to
deliver personalized results and responses.

*FramerD* consists of two main components: 

* a **portable distributed object-oriented database** designed to
  support the maintenance and sharing of knowledge bases. Unlike other
  object-oriented databases, FramerD is optimized for the sort of
  pointer-intensive data structures used by semantic networks, frame
  systems, and many intelligent agent applications.

* a flexible and performant scripting language based on **Scheme**
  with special provisions for *Prolog*-style non-deterministic
  programming, advanced text processing, and web application
  development.

FramerD databases readily include millions of searchable frames and
may be distributed over multiple networked machines.

FramerD is implemented in ANSI C for Unix-based platforms including
Linux and macOS.  In addition, Java libraries exist for accessing
FramerD databases and services.

FramerD was originally developed at
[MIT's Media Laboratory](www.media.mit.edu) by Ken Haase. The
laboratory's support, especially from its *News In the Future*
program, is gratefully acknowledged. The primary development of
FramerD is currently supported by
[beingmeta](https://www.beingmeta.com/), a developer of
next-generation content and knowledge management tools.
