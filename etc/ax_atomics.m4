# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PTHREAD([ACTION-IF-FOUND[, ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro figures out how to build C programs using POSIX threads. It
#   sets the PTHREAD_LIBS output variable to the threads library and linker
#   flags, and the PTHREAD_CFLAGS output variable to any special C compiler
#   flags that are needed. (The user can also force certain compiler
#   flags/libs to be tested by setting these environment variables.)
#
#   Also sets PTHREAD_CC to any special C compiler that is needed for
#   multi-threaded programs (defaults to the value of CC otherwise). (This
#   is necessary on AIX to use the special cc_r compiler alias.)
#
#   NOTE: You are assumed to not only compile your program with these flags,
#   but also link it with them as well. e.g. you should link with
#   $PTHREAD_CC $CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS $LDFLAGS ... $PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS
#
#   If you are only building threads programs, you may wish to use these
#   variables in your default LIBS, CFLAGS, and CC:
#
#     LIBS="$PTHREAD_LIBS $LIBS"
#     CFLAGS="$CFLAGS $PTHREAD_CFLAGS"
#     CC="$PTHREAD_CC"
#
#   In addition, if the PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE thread-attribute constant
#   has a nonstandard name, defines PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE to that name
#   (e.g. PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED on AIX).
#
#   Also HAVE_PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is defined if pthread is found and the
#   PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT symbol is defined when compiling with
#   PTHREAD_CFLAGS.
#
#   ACTION-IF-FOUND is a list of shell commands to run if a threads library
#   is found, and ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND is a list of commands to run it if it
#   is not found. If ACTION-IF-FOUND is not specified, the default action
#   will define HAVE_PTHREAD.
#
#   Please let the authors know if this macro fails on any platform, or if
#   you have any other suggestions or comments. This macro was based on work
#   by SGJ on autoconf scripts for FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) (with help
#   from M. Frigo), as well as ac_pthread and hb_pthread macros posted by
#   Alejandro Forero Cuervo to the autoconf macro repository. We are also
#   grateful for the helpful feedback of numerous users.
